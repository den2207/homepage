Comment
"We all know that a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. This program kicks you in the pants and gets you to move, little by little, towards where you want to be. I signed up because I'm writing a story that takes place at the circus. I thought maybe they've got quickly digested stuff about the circus, but no! And yet, there's valuable material about ""art is theft,"" and that is helping me deconstruct the influences behind what I'm crafting, and how to make them my own.

Live Large. Be Bold. Have Faith. Fear Nothing."
Don‚Äôt have a lot of time to get to the meat of evert book that I want to read and the app does it for me! Just love it!!
Muy practico. En realidad me encanta leer libros y m√°s escucharlos. Creo que estos res√∫menes son muy buenos y puedes leerlos o escucharlos.
"I love short self help lessons but most of them have many ambiguous examples that are hard to relate to, making it difficult to implement their premise in to my own life in an any type of easy or entry level sort of way, making the possibility of any transition highly improbable. 
So far I‚Äôve heard only two books on this app and I have more notes and simple actions that I can take, at any time in my day, to actually start the process of positively changing my own life. 
I highly recommend this app to anyone struggling in any areas of their lives or even just want to become more intelligent and realistic about the unrealistic expectations and beliefs of this world. 
Great job!"
This app is amazing so far and it‚Äôs helped me so much mentally
I highly recommend Headway.  15 minutes turns into an hour.  it‚Äôs a great way to get a flavor for new books before committing to the whole thing.  Also a great way to review previously read books.
learning a lot, and UI is very friendly and clean üòé
Summaries need more examples on how to implement concepts into real life. Some concepts are confusing to understand but overall excellent information from great resources.
Summaries are succinct and useful
Got to buy the app because of the Facebook visualizer/explainers‚Ä¶ but the app is only text and audio‚Ä¶ I could not yet find one visual explainers ‚Ä¶ seems like misleading advertisement
"I object to the commentary that some rule is right wing! There may be a book where you object to its Left wing commentary, but I doubt it. 
If you had commentary on a book you considered right or left wing, then it‚Äôs wrong to do so in either case.

I will likely NOT renew my subscription."
I absolutely love this app. So convinient. Great books choices. Makes life easier for who has a busy life and wanna keep up with self growth.
"Any app without a free trial period should be classified as ""required in-app purchases"". It‚Äôs an abusive waste of time to only find this out after answering lots of questions. Let‚Äôs not support this type of ""bait-and-switch"" in-app purchases.

Oh, just learned they ONLY display the free trail option when you try to close the app. Schlocky."
Everyone is ‚Äúbusy.‚Äù But no one should be too busy to learn. Learning makes people and the world better. Headway is a fantastic tool for learning skills, knowledge, and helpful ways to improve yourself. It‚Äôs jam-packed with compressed information, so you can learn the key points and share them with your friends. Get Headway and get ahead!
With my attention span, it is simple to stay interested and follow along. Easy to read. I read along while listening to the audio. This is perfect for my demanding work life.
"I got this app to listen to on my drive. Unfortunately, the AI voice reading the text is unbearable. It almost sounds good but it just enough off to be very annoying. 

If you‚Äôre just planning on reading yourself then you‚Äôll probably be happy."
This app is great at creating nugget books. This is exactly like it sounds. Basically, they take the content and create great nuggets that are easy to consume and remember. Plus, each book has a link if you‚Äôd like to purchase the full edition. I‚Äôve ‚Äúread‚Äù 3 books in two days and loving it!
This is such a  productive way to read and grow in knowledge .
"Do you want a special offer? Do you want a special offer? Do you want a special offer?

üóø"
Great app with many different benefits to your daily life
For those seeking self-development this is the best app. Truth is, I wasn‚Äôt sure if the subscription was worth it at the beginning. But the amount of resources you get for what you pay is incredible! Absolutely worth it, I am sure these books and resources will definitely help me understand myself better. Also, thank you for supporting Ukraine ‚ù§Ô∏è
The easy tests followed by all the different literature is amazing!
Real great app
I feel like every topic I have hit on, had the perfect amount of information packed in.
Love it. That‚Äôs all I need to say!
I really wanted to try this and I went through all the questions to see how much it would cost. There‚Äôs a discount for $59.99 for 12 months or $39.99 for 12 weeks. Not too bad but the owners of the app say in their description that it auto renews when you choose : weekly, monthly, yearly ‚Ä¶ no! That‚Äôs a lie. It would only let me choose to pay the full 12 weeks or 12 months upfront. If I could have paid weekly or monthly, I would‚Äôve continued but I‚Äôm not paying $60 for a year and not know that I will truly use it. Would also be nice if they gave a free week trial or something. Oh well. So 3 stars because I‚Äôm sure this is good but the description is deceitful.
I downloaded this based on as that showed quick-summary charts.  I was inundated with subscription offers, saw book summaries and selection customization, but no charts. It appears to be similar to other book summary apps such as Blinkist, but far more aggressive and annoying in forcing you to subscribe.
Terrible app. I do not recommend. Most of these books you can get for free anyways.
I like my first day experience.  I want to know more how this app will assist me.
Since downloading this app I have used it daily. It is truly inspiring and motivating. Highly recommend
I want to try this App to see if I like it, but you can‚Äôt get the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù without signing up in such a way that you have to cancel by a certain date to avoid charges.  Also there is an auto renew feature that I really hate, because if I sign up for a year and stop using it I will likely forget to cancel and get charged again the next year.  If the App is good, people will sign up AFTER the trial and continue signing up, don‚Äôt make it mandatory.
You ads on Facebook illustrate Infographics. I bought the app based on this feature. I can‚Äôt find the infographics that you advertise. Where are they? Do they exist? If this is an advertising ploy please stop this practice and refund my purchase. If I have overlooked, please provide information on how to locate.
They advertise the test and make you do it but then won‚Äôt give you results unless you pay. Don‚Äôt waste your time
Everything is with fee or membership. Don‚Äôt even bother downloading this stupid app. It is just a waste of time. It asks you all those questions and not even give you anything without you paying. Why ask for money in the beginning and stop wasting people‚Äôs precious time??!?!??
‚Ä¶ and the ability to listen to these books. I also like that they have a ton of books on various categories. Highly recommend it!
I‚Äôll probably be buying the year‚Äôs subscription. This app makes it so easy to find and read/listen to books I SHOULD be reading but u wouldn‚Äôt buy myself normally. I love how intuitive the recommended books are for me, yet it still gives me the option to browse its large collection at my will. I really love this app and you will too.
Clear, concise and incredibly helpful!  Especially love the cards you can create to help you remember core concepts from a reading.
Fantastic way to ‚Äúread‚Äù handfuls of great book‚Äôs every week in just a couple of hours!!
Bad app
Nothing has helped me more in life than these simple, quick, straight to the point summaries.
"Their ads tell you one thing about the apps but the app is another. I wonder if the developers of the app know they can be sue for it. 

Do not bother to download this app based in the Ads they use to lure you in you wont like it."
I was so excited to download this app, but it appears to cost $ for ANY and ALL access. I should have researched it better. Even a couple of freebies would allow me to see if this app is worth a subscription toward career and personal goals.
I love reading, and never have time. This app has been a great way to download the gist of books that I would probably never get through otherwise.
This does not explain anything about the product:   You answer a few questions and it wants your $$$.    It has nothing to do with me or any personalized system.   Too bad, I really thought I might enjoy it.
"No need to push your political beliefs using Ukraine colors on your app! 
This war was instigated by the Biden / Leftists war hawks and NATO pushing weapons into Ukraine. A clear instigation of aggression toward Russia don‚Äôt you think?
What if Russia would have been influencing politics in Mexico and selling their weapons tech into Mexico, what would the US have done about it? 
Maybe the same as what Russia did?
Stop this war! A peace negotiation is what the world deserves!"
Wanted an app that helps with accountability towards personal growth in a fun way and this nails it. Now when I‚Äôm bored instead of looking at social media or sports I‚Äôm using this to continue leveling up my life
It‚Äôs a nice way to browse before purchasing a book!
Very informative and helpful with literally ANY subject!
It‚Äôs a great what to start the day. 20 minutes of audio and reading to get the mind going with some of the best knowledge a person can consume.
No product has ever wowed me to the point of leaving a review. This is life changing. I am glued to my phone and I wanted to be more productive but my ADHD won‚Äôt let me sit down and read a book. This app is laid out like a social media account and now I have the best of both worlds. I never feel guilty about being on my phone anymore because these were all of the books on my list to read. It‚Äôs killing two birds with one stone!
they ask all types of questions before telling you to pay $55 or more. it doesn‚Äôt make sense why not tell me if costs before asking all them questions
I use this app daily. It‚Äôs helping me to be more educated!
This App helps me stay on track with my goals. This year I want to get back to reading more books frequently and having these reminders help. Also, I love how they summarize books and recommend great books to read.  I have sent this app to my sister. That way, they can benefit from the same rewards and more.
"I like the breakdown of the books. The suggestions are great. 

I‚Äôm not too far into the program but the app needs a few adjustments. I feel like it‚Äôs a little difficult to navigate or I am just expecting too much. 

The testing isn‚Äôt fully accurate. I have a very low placement in communication according to this. 
It‚Äôs possible I implied I have a difficult time approaching people.  When, I just have no want to approach people. 

I feel like I‚Äôm being forced to listen to topics to get to the next level. There should be an option to suggest a different book on the subject."
It‚Äôs crazy how intuitive this app was at figuring out through asking questions, which books to suggest to me. And that they are condensed summaries is all the more amazing. Finishing one is such a confidence boost! Unreal Awesomeness!!!ü§òüèºüî• love the app and will continue using it. The subscription is worth it!
the internal rage i felt after that "we have a gift for you!" every 2 picoseconds made me age 10 years. ITS NOT A GIFT IF IM PAYING YOU. you advertise the app as free yet every feature is behind a paywall, which of course you wouldnt know until you downloaded the app. also, overpriced. if you really want people to improve their mental health stop being a greedy capitalistic cringe corp
I Wish I Could Afford To Keep It Past The Free Trial
"I was excited to use this app, but the audio summaries are truly terrible. It‚Äôs a very robotic automated voice, so it‚Äôs really difficult to listen to. I wish they had someone reading the summaries. 

I am also disappointed by the customer service. There was no free trial, so I paid for three months up front. I immediately asked for a refund and a cancellation when I realized I would never want to use it. They did not help."
ü§Ø
"It‚Äôs a nice app, makes me read everyday and get tips on how to go about life situations.
7/10‚úÖ"
Unless you pay 49.99 you‚Äôre going to get a pop up every 30 seconds - one minute saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got a free gift for you‚Äù which isn‚Äôt free at all. It‚Äôs just them shoving a 49.99 in app purchase down your throat. I wanted to use this app but it‚Äôs marketing tactics are gone deaf. Deleted.
I love this app I love to read and this is an amazing way to read with audio or you can just read to yourself if you want I recommend this app it you have ADHD and disabilities please try the app I paid for a year worth for my investment to myself you should do the same
This breaks down and helps you grow as a person as promised.
You can‚Äôt access the majority of the app without paying for a subscription. There are many ‚Äúgifts‚Äù and ‚Äúachievements‚Äù throughout the app that make you click through nonsense only to get prompted to buy a subscription at every turn. One of the big features of the app is the intelligence type test in which you click through the entire test only to have to pay for a subscription to see your results. The books themselves are very robotic and there isn‚Äôt really anything special about the summaries that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get from SparkNotes or a Wikipedia page. I wanted to like this app but I couldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone that doesn‚Äôt want to pay for a subscription because it‚Äôs pretty much useless without it.
I don‚Äôt have this problem with other apps but this one keeps crashing on me!!!  Frustrating
This app has great books upon your physical mental and emotional health  has book uopn getting money staying focus and sums up the book with all the highlights from the book
Love it because it goes straight to the point, I would like to have more ways to memorize the content.
I paid for a yearly subscription and have loved using headway. Ive recommended it to so many people and I‚Äôve been using for well over 100 days. I was signed in but I guess not enough?? I lost all my progress when I switched devices. It‚Äôs now almost annoying to go in and sift through all the books for what I have and haven‚Äôt read as well as see my progress in different challenges I had begun. If I‚Äôm signed in, it should automatically save the books I‚Äôve read. If I sign onto instagram on my phone and then go on instagram on an iPad it doesn‚Äôt erase all the posts I‚Äôve liked on the phone, right? This app should apply the same logic.
"As a person who enjoys boiling things down to essential items and always on the go, I value Headway because I can get my daily personal development when my schedule needs me to get flexible. 

Also acts as a trailer for books I think about buying. I have a habit of buying books, get the main idea midway, decide I need something different, and add it to my Mt. Everest of books.

Headway lets me date the book before committing to it and I like that."
Poor app just trying to trick you into subscription. No visual learning as displayed in ad, just summaries. I was already using other apps for that.
I love this app!! I have one issue, why the share button doesn‚Äôt work? Or do I have to pay to have that feature? I have a subscription. My share button still is not working. No one has contacted me about this.
Despite the fact that it‚Äôs not free, I really enjoy using the Headway app. If you‚Äôre like me and have a limited amount of time to read OR you get ‚Äúchoice overwhelm‚Äù and you don‚Äôt know WHICH book to pick up - Headway is a great way to get the key snippets of a book so you don‚Äôt have to read the whole thing OR you can treat it like a teaser and decide that the full book is for you. I‚Äôm loving it!
I tried this a year ago and sent them an email about having landscape (like every other reader out there) and they said it was in process. They only have 300 books. Pay a little more for Blinkist that has 5,000 books and so many more features and just let this one go bankrupt. It needs to imo.
If you want to learn quicker this app is for you!
Highly recommend even if you think you have a positive mindset or plan in place.
Wish I could rate no stars‚Ä¶.Promo After promo, ended paying 30 dlls trying to use the app, be careful on what you click as they just keep invoicing new services you could think is part of the app.  I was excited and now super disappointed and feel scammed.
The first time I downloaded this app I knew that it would be helpful in so many ways! I started with a free trail, but immediately knew that it was worth paying for the full benefits! If you want to learn new skills in every area of your life I suggest this app to use daily for self growth and improving relationships with others.
Download now to change your behavior
Keep it up!
Everything is an up charge. Everything you do leads you to some ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù screen. Good luck trying to navigate or discover anything without some kind of payment. Almost makes you wonder if they don‚Äôt want you to know it‚Äôs not worth it.
No words to describe how wonderful this app is
Very valuable and relevant information!!!!!
Very helpful summaries. Encourages me to keep progressing in my life in every way I can.
"App: pay me $60 and I'll help you fix everything wrong with you. Take this personality test of 30 questions to pinpoint your exact problem, now pay me $30 to get your answer. ""Here have a 50% discount"" everytime you open or accidently close out.
But as the title says, at least you get a single free book summary everyday. Not that they're that good but still ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ"
My favorite part of the book and summary were examples of application.  The examples were practical and straightforward.  I appreciate the simplicity of the information without over simplifying it.
"I purchased this app with the intention of accessing the prominently (they are the first picture in the app summary!) advertised infographic summaries. It turns out that they are NOT included in the app access and must be purchased separately via a website. Very misleading advertising for a feature that is not included.

UPDATE: The developer had the audacity to respond to my review without acknowledging the misleading nature of their advertising (confirmed by other reviews as well). Their claim is that the advertising currently in use (with prominently featured infographic NOT available in the app) refers to a previous version of the app. This is very much not the case and I would love to request a refund."
I‚Äôm not a big reader, but the way the reading is setup in this app is PERFECT for me! It highlights all the important information/insights so you aren‚Äôt getting lost in the ‚Äúfluff‚Äù of a full book.
I would love this app if they used real human voices. I would even pay more. I just can‚Äôt tolerate the computer narration.
Headway‚Äôs style works for me because the amount of useful information I can read that consistently improves my mindset, discipline, and attitude can be read or listened to in short to the point bits of knowledge that sticks with me easily and reminds me that I am working on creating a better happier me that lives in the present moment with more joy out of life. I have a feeling of accomplishing valuable absorption every time so far.
I love this app! I give me the main point of the book that I need to know! When I get to the end of the summary. I know if I want to purchase the book or not! Also, they pick book that is right down my alley!
so far so good
I love the concept of this app. This is now my go to app to read any book. They have a huge volume, variety of books available for every reader!! Kudos to the team who built this app!!
I really enjoy listening to these books in the car instead of the radio makes me feel like I‚Äôm actually doing something intentional even during my time in the car!
If you are thinking about downloading Headway, download it! It is absolutely worth the money. It has such a variety of content that there is always something to interest you in some way. Perfect for self-improvement
I really like what they're doing here. I like the efficency of finding multiple books that the AI gives me based on my personality and my interests. However, the constant deals get kinda annoyingü•≤
"This app has a lot of great features to streamline how you ingest information from books. I‚Äôve come across a number of bugs though:

- trying to use the same account on multiple devices has been difficult to impossible (it keeps asking for a new subscription)
- the achievements don‚Äôt always get credited and the progress bar doesn‚Äôt always remember what you‚Äôve done
- occasional spelling and grammar mistakes in the summaries
- not a bug, but there isn‚Äôt an application for your desktop yet"
Just useless. Incredibly reductive summaries of books compiled and read by AI. I thought t there would be other features like quizzes but nope. They pull you in with that in their ads but the only real function of the app is to make lazy people feel a sense of pyrrhic accomplishment. You'd be better off reading/listening to one entire book than listening to these useless summaries.
Amazing, absolutely amazing
Not only is it helping me mentally grow for my self love I have read summary‚Äôs that‚Äôs help me learn about money , gaining confidence and just random fiction I support you trying out this app for a week it could help you more than you except
One book a day! It‚Äôs a hit and miss for awhile untill you find books you relate to. Then, it fits for YOU and your desires
I found this really interesting but if you have no musical knowledge it is a little bit hard to understand it all. However, it made me want to do more research. Overall, I liked it.
It‚Äôs a fun app that lets you read what the entire book is trying to say under 15 minutes or so by summarising the essential factors of the books.
Nice bite sized bits of info
This app is remarkable the books are so to the point.
"I am a small business owner who values integrity over becoming rich. 

I was inspired to download the app and then pay $60 based on a graphic titled ‚ÄúWhat is Your Sexuality Type?‚Äù with what was intended to look like an example of what my personal results would look like if I were to sign up, and then further pay up.

Instead, it‚Äôs a library of cliff notes for many of the most well-known self-help books over the past 20 years. Most of them are about getting rich. Why not offer an honest portrayal of the app in your marketing?

I don‚Äôt want to learn how to do business in this manner, and I respect my clients too much to take advantage of them, even if it would make me rich."
This app is a love letter to people that are hungry for knowledge but lack the desire, time or patience to read a whole book. It goes straight to the important points saving you time. If you are an auditory learner you have the option to listen to the summaries it‚Äôs pretty great!
Worth every cent for the successful people in life.
So far so good, much more to explore.
Great app to help you when you‚Äôre lost on what to read and where to go. I have been using this for a week and I feel more knowledgeable and adequate to my goals then ever before.
"Why pay for a summary of books when that summary gives you absolutely no information and you would still have to buy the book. 
I can see reading free summaries to entice you to buy the books but I don‚Äôt see the point of paying for useless summaries. 
I made sure to read the summary on a few books I own just to make sure I was correct on the actual amount being left out. 
It was amazing how much was skipped over, left out or mentioned but with no detail. 
You can get better information on each book by reading the book‚Äôs reviews. 
There were many books in this app I have on my reading list. I was so hoping to knock them all out in one place but it looks like I will still have to buy them because there is no information in this app."
It has some really nice book summaries and a lot of content.   The reminder notifications are really helpful too, without being annoying.
So far I have enjoyed using this app. It‚Äôs a must try app to increase your knowledge.
This is where I go when I want to feel inspired and motivated. The app has a huge selection of amazing books that you can read or connect to your car and listen while you‚Äôre driving. In life, every second counts, and knowledge is POWER!
Honestly this app is phenomenal. Instead of mindlessly scrolling Facebook I get on here and I have learned so much in just one week.
I‚Äôm only using the free portion of the app so far, but the reads are nice.
‚Ä¶
Great app but it needs a dark mode feature for reading at night.
Great app
Straight forward and easy to use. Great tool to learn or just ge happy.
Best way to quickly absorb new knowledge
I‚Äôm a busy mom, and also have a short attention span üò¨ who gets bored quickly while reading (thanks, adhd!!) I want to be a reader but it takes me forever to finish a book. This app has been spot on - exactly what I‚Äôve needed! It breaks it down to the main points & gives you the nuggets of info you need. ieasy to listen to while I‚Äôm cleaning, driving, on a walk. Love it!!!
Just getting started, as a high school students, these books do a great job of teaching me what to expect when making my money work for me so I can focus on myself, great app!
Yes it‚Äôs a great app
Got me motivated!
"In just a few minutes I covered a brief history of the Ukraine war, how to enter into a conversation, and a book on financial literacy. Headway offers so much information in small chunks that make it easy for anyone to read and LEARN something!

There are hundreds of available topics and book summaries and the ‚Äúgamification‚Äù aspect makes me want to check in regularly (I like streaks and badges :). 

Overall: I would recommend if you‚Äôve want to learn something new, regularly."
They make you spend about 10-15 minutes building your profile and selecting things you want to improve about yourself and then boom 15.99 a month!  What a waste of time.
This app is amazing. Thanks to this app I can easily read a great non-fiction book per day. It keeps me on my toes for work and my personal life. Absolutely love it!
I will still read some of them, but it's great to be just be able to listen/read a 15 min overview of the concepts!
Learned a lot from just a couple of reads!
This has helped me u sweat and the meaning of the different types of love it‚Äôs like I know how to comfort, please, help, and care for the person this is so helpful in many other ways too!!
You can‚Äôt view the library or use any of the features before they lock you into a major subscription. Don‚Äôt let them scam you.
To be fair I‚Äôm only 8 I don‚Äôt even know how to spell 8 but I wanted so badly to get this app and after 3 days of convincing with mom I got it and when it asked me how old I was the youngest option was 18-20 that‚Äôs 10 years older than me and that really got on my nerves I was very upset and in reality I can‚Äôt really say any positive things about the app because I got it 5 minutes ago so I just want to confirm my statement KIDS RULE doun‚Äôt ever forget it but as I said I can‚Äôt say any good things about it yet but I‚Äôm sure if I really try not to delete it I‚Äôll have loads of good stuff
"Honestly for me this app is perfect it gives you a whole bunch of inside scoops to further your knowledge about yourself and what you are destined to become! 5/5 from me!

-Felix"
"Rapid and intuitively cut to the chase solid principles of your choosing is refreshing.

I especially love the magazine article length summaries of several important and sage books I would tire of before completing if this offering wasn‚Äôt available."
Great app
This is my new social media. Reading Headway summaries is perfect for my busy life and keeps me off of mindless scrolling social media apps. I love Headway and I highly recommend it if you are looking to learn something new in your free time and live a more informed life :)
I don‚Äôt have enough time in my day for personal reading but this app allows me to do that.
Best app purchase I‚Äôve made!
Headway makes it so easy to learn, even if you have a busy lifestyle! :)
I keep coming back for its bite size learning options. I also find the suggestions really helpful if you don‚Äôt know where to start üëåüèº
I downloaded the app to do a test and try to improve myself and learn more about me. But I couldn‚Äôt even click on anything or get results without it ‚Äúoffering‚Äù me a subscription.
I have numerous book apps, I feel as if I have time to listen to the radio or the neighbor complaining or mowing the grass why can‚Äôt I be improving my knowledge, skills and vocabulary!? Here you can & it‚Äôs not long and drawn out to where you may feel you‚Äôve lost your free time. This is the app and it‚Äôs priced beautifully, I love it & know you will too!
The concept is great but can‚Äôt get over the creepy robot voices so I‚Äôve just been reading.
I just downloaded this app by chance and I CAN‚ÄôT PUT IT DOWN for a sec!!!!!!!!
"I‚Äôve wanted to read more but could never seem to find the time. This app has been great for pulling essential life changing tips
Out of books to immediately put into action! I love it !"
I am a voracious reader and learner but we all know there isn‚Äôt enough time in our busy lives to read all the books and articles we want to read. This app is the answer! It is easy to use, feels very personalized and allows me to read summaries of books in around 15 minutes and get just the highlights!  It‚Äôs perfect for a busy life!!
Unlimited pro version for Ukrainians and no free trial for Americans!
I have learned so many new things just in a couple days! I love being able to share theses things with people! 10/10 recommend this app!
App seems promising at first taking into account everything but is constantly bombarding me with ads for there deals and I am not able to do the stuff advertised because of it
App is pretty pointless you can get most of what it offers for less or included in another subscription you probably already have‚Ä¶ plus the blatant keep sending money to Ukraine propaganda is completely unnecessary‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt waste your 15min like I did
A great app.  Let‚Äôs me get through summaries of helpful tomes in record time, and with great recall.  I just renewed for my second year, and don‚Äôt intend to stop anytime soon!
Headway has helped me get focused and back I track.  Life happens and we fall out of practice.  I‚Äôm so glad I have tools at my finger tips and I‚Äôm eager to keep on going.
Thanks for nothing. The makers of this app only want to gather information about you. They even offer a personality quiz free but then turn around and ask for payment without disclosing any details about your quiz. It‚Äôs a total waste of time energy. Don‚Äôt download this.
As an entrepreneur I‚Äôm taking notes
Getting detailed summaries and boosting your intelligence levels from emotional intelligence, social skills, ways to improve your mental health + crush your goals and create more happiness is amazing. The best part you learn this in bite sized sessions.
I never write reviews, but this app is so bad it demands a review. The content is either written by an AI that skims the works poorly for meaning, or the editing is terrible. I struggle to connect incoherent sentences and am forced to try to extrapolate meaning from context rather than literal delivery. Do what I should have done and avoid paying money for this trash.
this app took $64 off of my card without me knowing. i was still in the free trial and i woke up this morning to check my bank account and saw this app took money off of my card even though my free trial wasn‚Äôt really up? i‚Äôm saddened that i have to delete and unsubscribe from headway but this is a scam do not buy they will take your money as soon as they can regardless of when the free trial is up. i am not the only person this has happened to either check the reviews !! don‚Äôt buy this app
Very easy to learn and keep important ideas of books in your mind.
I ended up only using it once and not liking it, which made this an overly expensive product for me.
Top 5 so worthy!!
How do you charge people for an app that has content filled with mistakes? I thought I was getting an app with legitimate content to read. It‚Äôs painful to read a text with so many mistakes and really makes me question the legitimacy of this app. Who is writing these texts??  Very disappointed.
I‚Äôve always found it hard to stay engaged when I read nonfiction books. Headway allows me to get the straight knowledge from each nonfiction book without having to push myself to complete a 200+ page boom. I‚Äôm able to highlight the prices of content that speak the most to me AND it‚Äôs also heightened my interest in some of these books that I‚Äôve considered reading the full thing to get a better picture of the content that I‚Äôve learned.
Love learning straight to the point and using common sense ( the les common)
"I love the idea of the app, but I‚Äôm frustrated with two things.

1. Sometimes the summaries have a big impact on me, and I want to flag them as something to read again, but there is no functionality to label books you‚Äôve already read. 

2. The repetition tab appears to only be populated with their premade highlight, which, for me, haven‚Äôt been the most useful pieces of the summaries. I wish there was somewhere I could easily view all of my highlights so I could review the info I personally found most useful 

All you can do now is read summaries, make a list of what you‚Äôd like to read in the future, a list of what you have read, the predetermined highlights you can add to reminders, and the curated challenges."
This app is great. If you want to read more and don‚Äôt have a lot of time, this is the app for you. It takes some of the greatest books and summarizes the key points in bite sized content that you can study and apply to your life to become a better version of yourself. They also have a quiz to help you understand your intelligence type and what type of learner you are. In just 2 days I‚Äôve read 5 books and it has motivated me to achieve my goals. I highly recommend it!
I look forward daily to listening and reading the random books chosen by Headway
I wanted to love this app but the summaries are really poorly written. It‚Äôs a great idea with a beautiful layout and was perfect until I got to actually reading the summaries‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm disappointed. The key points are exciting but the explanations feel redundant and poorly executed. Find better readers and writers please!
So much information is available in easy chunks that are not overly time consuming!
I have always desired to read, but rarely find the time to do it for myself. I‚Äôve already read two books in two days through Headway! I am really enjoying this so much.
Everything literally everything costs in this app I took the intelligence type test and it tried to price me for my results
Well created app and a great way to improve your mind plus another reason why reading would absolutely be helpful
Perfect way to cumulatively improve oneself in a digestible and convenient manner.
I was recently assaulted while working & my energy still hasn‚Äôt came back yet. I love listening to this app (I downloaded it two days ago & have utilized the reading portion as well as the listening section, driving for a living makes always reading impossible) anyway, thank you so much for all this content, I am pretty sure after this free trial I will take full advantage of the $59 yearly package. I love to read, but with being on the road 12-16 hours daily, sometimes having something I can listen to is just the motivation I need. I will be back to my hustling self in no time!!!!! üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞
Amazing tool to become successful!
Really loving this app! Investing time in myself every morning by reading the book summaries the recommend has been very motivating!
Loving it!
"I don‚Äôt typically leave bad reviews. It takes a lot to get here and feel the need to share‚Ä¶
I bought this app and immediately regretted it. It‚Äôs utterly toxic. It forces you to read materials after a personality test to help ‚Äúimprove your life‚Äù and all the text REQUIRED to read through are each so toxic. The amount of misogyny, fat phobia, manipulation, and other horrible characteristics‚Ä¶ I am appalled however this app got a good rating makes me loose faith in the star-rates systems here. I genuinely want to cry. I can‚Äôt believe this all is charging people and doing well, which implied people are eating this up and I just wish people much much better than what this app provides. Shameful and horrendous experience. I stayed on here for a span of time that only became progressively disappointing. I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt even ethically read what they *require* in order to experience what they consider life improvement. I feel horrible."
This app has helped me prioritize my goals. Step by step key points to get you to your goal, it‚Äôs laid out beautifully and keeps me interested in continuing on.
I am able to listen to books that have improved my life easily and quickly
I love this app, it‚Äôs especially good for people who are trying to get into reading. Really helps develop a sense of genre you like and definitely cool how there is a free daily read everyday.
I‚Äôm not sure what its all about, but they just want a subscription without really giving a teaser of the goods. If you keep rejecting the yearly offer, it keeps going down as you try to explore this app to see if $30 a year is worth the what they think this app can do. I vote no confidence!
do yourself a favor and download this app
I was skeptical, but took a shot and it‚Äôs very helpful with information to help you with life.
Very expensive app for what you get!
Very informative and helpful would love the whole book option as it can be helpful to interpret the main points of a book or what the author is saying.
I‚Äôm not much of a reader but reading these book summaries has definitely caused me to read more and more. Books are generally too long but these book summaries are short and to the point. I highly recommend it.
I was led to the app with the promise of a $100.00 voucher that I never got to use. Don't even know where to find it.  Then was promised 90% off a single item that I never got.  Just be aware that you probably won't get those things.
The decision to buy and subscribe was the best I‚Äôve ever made! This is an amazing tool to develop yourself on a daily basis! I roll the dice and listen every day when I walk the dog! Easy and oh so great!
They advertise this app with Infograph‚Äôs, which is why I got it. No Infograph‚Äôs at all just book summary‚Äôs. Such a waste of money. Massive false advertising, they should be ashamed!
I downloaded this app and was offered a 7 day free trial when I clicked to confirm the free 7 day trail $59.99 was immediately taken from my account. I would greatly appreciate my funds bring refunded since I did NOT approve a 59.99 order but did approve a 7 DAY TRAIL! This company has provided me with false advertising and stolen my money. I not only immediately cancelled the subscription but also deleted the app completely after being charged. I WANT MY MONEY PLEASE
Good insights to business and personal development.
3 stars simply because its a membership
All compositions very nice and easy to listen to.
"I downloaded the app because of an advertised sexuality test that looked fun for me and my partner only to discover there is no such test in the app.

There‚Äôs a long user creation process filled with leading questions only to discover it‚Äôs an app like Blinkist."
The ads have pictures of infographics as part of the app, but I installed and joined the subscription only to contact support and find out infographics are a paid add on and not part of the app? The summaries were interesting I just didn‚Äôt like the way it is being portrayed so have canceled.
I had really high hopes for this app. I‚Äôve listened to a few books, but honestly, whoever is recording them is not great. Each one sounds like a mix of AI and those top 10 YouTube videos. I just can‚Äôt get past the voice to actually hear the material.
I appreciate the set up of the app . It‚Äôs helped me with mindfulness and in general good reading, I am looking forward to a lower subscription price once it gets more subscribers . It is totally worth the Pennies  spent tho
"Headway is awesome! Being an avid reader myself, I enjoy the efficiency & simplicity that Headway provides. I can just turn on a quick book as I start my morning routine, walk my dog, & run my errands. 

Looking for healthy insights & knowledge on the go? Check out Headway!

Signed up when it asked for my Gender it gave three options .. Male Female and Other .  Lost me there . Won‚Äôt spend my money on anything like this
3 days in, 3 books done. Really can make this into a daily reading resource.
Just started using Headway I love how the information on here is so vast! Will definitely keep using and recommend to friends
I love it
I love this app, and these books. I often intend to read but just get overwhelmed with life and managing time - this is the perfect bite size rendition of the key points of a book, which then inform me which ones I want to go deeper into and inspires/motivates me to actually read. I would recommend this to anyone who intends to read more and is interested. Like my personal trainer says; the best greens for your health are the ones you EAT! And this is perfect for my curious mind and on the go life. The only compliant is that I really do not like the voice of the female narrator and think they should find a replacement which as soothing and neutral as the male voice. As a female myself I find it kind of disappointing. She has A TERRIBLE voice and absolutely affects the experience of the books and overshadows the quality!!!
"Love to read these tidbits every morning. I feel like it‚Äôs a way to capture over arching information and themes without committing to an entire book. 

An improvement would be to have a function to save my favorite read with notes of my own. There are books that I want to buy but can‚Äôt remember which ones after sometime. I do like the highlight notes and history of what I have read but an evolution would be a way to mark my favorite reads."
I was excited about this app, but after a week or so with it I deleted it, despite paying the $39.99. The book summaries are as if they are written by someone whose first language isn‚Äôt English; they‚Äôre clunky, hard to read, and poorly written. The audio book versions are clearly by a bot, and combined with the poorly written summaries, feels like it‚Äôs a joke or something. The app also never fully loads the first time I open it- I have to completely close the app and restart it every time. Waste of my $40, I could have just bought the books themselves. Don‚Äôt waste your money!!!
App upsells you on free features that turn out to be paid. Why make me go through a quiz just to tell me pay, I thought it was free. I get car salesman vibes immediately. Deleted.
Interesting test, nice book summaries to work on my weaker traits.
Great app. Gets straight to the point.
Great advice & motivational pieces from credible sources!
Quick, easy reads to pick up the main points of whatever you‚Äôre interested in learning.
So to be fully transparent, I did download this app and then deleted it once I saw it was going to cost money. But within a few minutes I re-downloaded it as I was struck by some of the reading topics I had seen at first glance. I thought what the heck I‚Äôll try it for the free trial and then delete if I didn‚Äôt find it worth while. I am on day 4 and absolutely love this App. Wish I would have found this sooner. I am looking forward to the tools this has to offer for personal growth. Easy, convenient and can go to this throughout the day when I have a few minutes here and there. Allowing me to use my time more effectively.  New year for a better me.
"Headway is a great idea, but the summaries don‚Äôt measure up to the hype. 

I‚Äôve worked through six books so far, but have decided to request a refund because the app is so poorly written. The writing is sophomoric, clumsy, inarticulate and downright confusing. My guess is that the summaries are probably written by writers who have yet to reach a needed proficiency in English. 

The result is the loss of nuance and complexity from the authors‚Äô arguments and opinions. Here‚Äôs a sample from Headway‚Äôs summary of Aziz Gazipura‚Äôs ‚ÄúNot Nice‚Äù (Chapter 5): 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre rushing down to the elevator; you need to get 10 minutes left of your lunch break to properly utilize with a donut from downstairs.‚Äù 

Properly utilize with a donut?  

This type of poorly constructed sentence and confusing syntax drives momentary confusion that detracts from the whole experience.  Instead of absorbing the main points from the book, I ended up annoyed at the half-baked writing that isn‚Äôt worth the money I paid. The writing also diminishes the intellectual impact of the books themselves and does their authors a great disservice. 

High expectations unsatisfied. I‚Äôd like my money back, please."
I needed help inspiration and knowledge and this app is getting it done!
Theres just some things that could make this app perfect, more features, and what not. But the app is awesome, thank you and cant wait for future updates!
I was reading ‚ÄúTalking to Strangers‚Äù and it mentioned the interaction between the officer and Sandra Bland.  I think this was inappropriate to bring this up knowing the released footage and news coverage. Distasteful. I stopped my subscription and deleted this app.
Great app.  Question, my discover tab never reloads‚Ä¶ always blank.. how do I fix?
Smooth, fairly easy to navigate, the more generic sounding narrater used for the audio is not so bad. Just wish they had a feature that brought up books and titles that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù to things you‚Äôve previously listed to or liked. So far, pretty great.
Don‚Äôt give them your email at least!?  They glean lots of info and then hit you with the costs.  Free trial is a sham.
Maybe if it was a little cheaper I‚Äôd buy it, but I really enjoyed the free trial.
Wonderful knowledge of books. I‚Äôm 26, colorful, a girl, and am trying finish school in tech. My fav read is How To Be Apart of The 5AM CLub. It‚Äôs really helped my productivity!
I like how these summaries let me take a nice big bite out of so many titles I've wanted to read. I tend to lose steam after I feel like I've gotten the meat and potatoes of the book and things start to seem repetitive. This gives me the gist without droning on about infestation unnecessary details.
It‚Äôs great to listen while I am working or have nothing to do!
Good for self improvement!
Excellent advice and combination of occult and western science and philosophy.
I have a hard time remembering what I read, but Headway helps remind me and helps solidly the main ideas of what I read in the full books. I‚Äôd definitely recommend it. I‚Äôve also found books on here that I couldn‚Äôt find on Blinklist like ‚ÄúAsk and it is Given.‚Äù
Leadership and goals great
I have 4 little kids so I don‚Äôt have time to read books like I want to. This app is the perfect way to get the information I want because the summaries are quick to read and give me all the main points from the books.
"I purchased the yearly ‚Äúfamily plan‚Äù which was bogus. Contacted customer service for Headway and they replied ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have a family plan, please login with the same username to share.‚Äù This makes absolutely no sense since each user has a program tailored to them. Asked for a refund after only a few days and they, like many other developers, hide behind Apple stating that only Apple can issue a refund. 

Requested a refund from Apple and they are equally as useless. They denied my refund stating it was ineligible for a refund. So basically, I‚Äôm stuck with what still shows up on my subscriptions as a ‚Äúfamily plan‚Äù and can‚Äôt get my money back."
"So, I believe this app is to sell books? I guess it‚Äôs kinda cool if that‚Äôs what I was looking for, but it wasn‚Äôt. Not exactly sure how different features of this app work?
If it‚Äôs just for giving you a brief look into what a books about, then it‚Äôs great!"
"Please stop asking for a review every time we click on a new selection. It‚Äôs quite annoying. Otherwise the app is ok.

Update:  The ‚ÄúReview Us‚Äù has slowed and I have been able to enjoy the app and listening to the many online books."
Being an adult is hard. Sometimes I need to let go of all that I‚Äôm mentally holding together - headway is a great tool for that! Nothing feels safer than taking a walk with someone else‚Äôs voice in my head - offering a lesson learned or a new way of thinking. The subject doesn‚Äôt matter, the experience of letting go knowing whatever content I‚Äôm injesting or distracting myself with will help me grow and that in itself is a positive experience. When I feel I can control nothing around me, curating the voice and the stories coming in, brings me a sense of peace. Headway has been the healthiest escape and gift that keeps on giving! Thanks for making me smarter a few minutes at a time! üòÅ
To anyone who is down, broke, rich, sad, happy; so anyone. This helps you in so many ways form your mindset to finances as a broke teenager trying to fin his way or a middle age person who is sick if that same  cubicle wall they stare at. Get this app!
So far so good.  I‚Äôm impressed with the content so far.
"These summaries of great books are amazing. I don‚Äôt have time to read novels, and I‚Äôm learning a tremendous amount via these 10 to 15 minute breakdowns! 

I just turned my business partner onto this, and she‚Äôs loving it too. I would honestly have paid twice as much for this app and still considered a bargainüëçüëç"
I love the fact that I can just take 20 min out my day to memorize a book, and gain valuable knowledge on downtime.
I love the summaries
This is exactly what I have needed for so long
Before i downloaded this app i was at the lowest point of my life. But with these books i have gotten a grasp on life for what it it and am determined to change my life for the better.
I‚Äôve always struggled listening to business or educational books. And this helps majorly. I‚Äôve been able to tackle more than half of my reading list in less than a month.
"the concepts this presents is terrific, however there are a few features it is missing that could make it a really excellent experience 

- password change option in settings
- display setting changes in settings 
- Multi factor authentication 
- sync reading time with Apple‚Äôs reading goal feature"
I am enamored with this app. I am so grateful to have found it and I am excited to see how much it transforms my life in regards to productivity and motivation. I love that we have the opportunity to read or listen; or engage in both and save exerts for later use. It has been 1 day since I downloaded the app however, I can already feel myself subconsciously releasing bad habits and thought patterns so that there is abundant room for magnanimous transformations. So thrilled to be making major ‚Äúheadway‚Äù in my one beautiful life! Thank you for this app and God bless you all on your journey to self actualization.
I was given a free trial (was fine) however, when I signed up it stated it would notify me before being charged. I never was, and then of course I was charged for a full year $60 that I did not plan on spending. Don‚Äôt sign up for the free trial unless you plan on paying for a year!
It‚Äôs worth trying. I haven‚Äôt found a bad resource yet.
I have enjoyed this app and all the features you have provided. It is very easy to use and the resources are Amazing!
"Anyone interested in self care should download this. 

Game changer."
Great stuff
This app is such an amazing resource for anyone who might find it difficult to make time to read books. This app gives you all the inside deets on so many great books in all aspects of life!
I don‚Äôt want this to set others‚Äô opinions of this app as I suspect the app has a lot of great value to it for people. But, the very first ‚ÄúInsight‚Äù I received after downloading it was; ‚ÄúFriendships that revolve around people are companies that research shows to be healthy, lasting and satisfying.‚Äù I had to read it 3 times over as the word ‚Äúcompanies‚Äù just didn‚Äôt make sense here. It‚Äôs not a word that would be generally used for people with English as a first language and it threw me. I asked my husband and he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably written by someone whose first language isn‚Äôt English. I think they mean ‚Äúrelationships.‚Äù This doesn‚Äôt fill me with great promise for the app. I‚Äôd rather an app that could give tidbits of info and insights that simply just make sense and you don‚Äôt have to reread several times. Also, it makes me feel like the content is just churned out from overseas, or from bots translating things. Not a great start but I‚Äôll persist for a bit. Any more though and I‚Äôll leave this app to the side.
It‚Äôs such a good app
"Just like a lot of people, I saw this app advertised with a lot of cool infographics and was truly looking forward to the idea of 15 minute book summaries. I scooted on over to the App Store, pressed that ‚ÄúGet‚Äù button and opened the app. To my pleasant surprise, I was greeted with the first paywall! The excitement grew within me when I declined, but the app told me I could get a new free book every day. 

I was intrigued with the idea this scam simulator wasn‚Äôt trying to force more paywalls when it asked me to take a personality test. ‚ÄúNot normal for a scam‚Äù, I thought. I took the personality test, taking time with each question. When I reached the end, I jumped for joy. The laughter and enthrallment reached its peak when I read the message ‚ÄúA Special Gift For You!‚Äù There it is. WOW. Only $29.99 to just look at my personality test results? I chuckled to myself, concluding this was a new, fresh take on a scam simulation app. I could hear the developer‚Äôs evil cackles ‚ÄúOf course these peasants wouldn‚Äôt suspect we wouldn‚Äôt give them their personality test results.‚Äù Genius.

Five out of five stars. $30-$60 is the perfect price to get someone in, only for them to find out they cannot get their test results, the books are read by an AI narrator, and there are zero sweet looking infographics to look at. 

Loved this experience!"
I really wish apps were required to tell you up front when you can‚Äôt use more than 50% of their functionality without subscribing, and required to list subscription costs on the app page, instead of after a 10 minute questionnaire. It might be a good service and under other circumstances I might have given it a chance, but I refuse to support an app that uses blatant psychological manipulation.
This app is simply awesome
It‚Äôs pretty good, lots of materials to access. My criticism is 2 part. One, the male voice that reads some of the books has a distracting accent. It‚Äôs a thick-ish east coast accent. And two, the book summaries tend to repeat themselves, literally the same sentence. I thought it was a glitch at first but no, some summaries have the exact same sentence or set of words back to back or within 10 seconds of each other.  Other than that, if you can get it for the sale price, it‚Äôs worth it for a year.
This is a great concept, but it‚Äôs annoying that AFTER I pay the annual subscription price, you are still charging extra for the infographics (that I thought were included) and are pushing other paid offers in the app.
This app seems to help a lot of people. Clean, easy on the eyes, and seems more effective like the reviews stated. But I have a problem with the test, why did you guys let me go through the whole process without telling me that I have to buy my way to see my own results. This is such a bad idea to let people think that they are going to see their results and then BAM! You have to pay to see something that you thought was free. That‚Äôs why I rated this app a 1 star. Good luck to anyone who payed for it and I hope your life is better.
This is pleasing to listen to and read it intentionally informs you on the important things in life to better yourself and to enhance your thought of training I would recommend y‚Äôall to download this app
I cant stop listening to these summaries. They are making me want yo get up right now snd work towards what im trying to accomplish at home. Decluttering & organizing & its 12:52 Am. I‚Äôm totally into this app.
Very informative and easy way to digest the main points in self improvement books.
Just started and they‚Äôre already delivering.
Headway is great for short listenings
so I downloaded this app about a few months ago and I didn‚Äôt exactly start listening to it right away. I actually listen to one story just a couple minutes but didn‚Äôt take the time out. Today I decided to pick a story and I did and I‚Äôm so happy that I actually got through it all. It does make me feel smarter! All working out of the gym the beginning of my work out I listen to it so I‚Äôm really excited to use this app every day and take a break from scrolling! I think you guys will really enjoy this app
Love this app
Right on information and current.
The book choices that were generated from my initial quiz were spot on and were mostly books I already wanted to read but didn‚Äôt want to waste time and money on if I didn‚Äôt like it- the chapter summaries are straight to the point, easy to digest, and make me want to read the whole book.
"This app was such a good idea! 
Love the content and the fact that it gets straight to the point! When you read the title that is exactly what will be in the text. 
You finish each summary feeling more motivated than when you start. 
This is a good way to spark change or whatever your goal is I‚Äôm sure you can achieve it with Headway once you stay consistent!"
Headway has been an excellent source of information. The snippets of information allow me to learn in the short bouts of free time I have.
Keeps me motivated.
Gets me going every time I read. Learning from all the resources and having all these fantastic book at the palm of my hand has been so convenient
It would be nice if this app would let me know they want to charge me before i spend time going through the entire process just to find out it is in fact not free.
Thought I‚Äôd have the option to read the full books you don‚Äôt. They say you have to buy the book. I don‚Äôt like the fact that someone else decides to get me a 6 page synopsis of a book that‚Äôs 400 pages. It‚Äôs very hard to put certain pieces together when every page is about something different.
Very good app
"When using family sharing, be aware! You must use the same login. This means my wife, and kids are all dating the same account. 

All of my saved reads are there for all to see. Some of which are private or inappropriate. 

Aside from that it‚Äôs been ok"
Believe me, this app will go a long way. I have learnt so many things through this amazing application. Thanks Team! Amazing product.
Te lleva de manera muy positiva y te impulsa a seguir adelante es magn√≠fico.
With rapid information technology world every bit of additional learning is crucial. And with headway i was able to fill the day with some quick summaries of books. Amazing!
The purpose of the app is amazing and I love what it has, but you can not do anything without buying things. You can only listen/ read one book. Then you have to pay for the others. I want to learn how to not let people control my life, but I have to pay to learn
Nothing like a daily dose of ‚Äòeasily digestible information‚Äô to help you become a better person in all aspects of your life, I feel like I‚Äôve understood more books in a month than ever could.
Something way more productive to do than endlessly scrolling social media.
Love learning in such a fast way
Appreciate the personalized, bite size learning however almost all of the audio narration is monotone and not engaging.
Not only do I feel accomplished when I finish a title quickly and pick up the main points, this app is definitely saving me money I would normally spend on books. I can use the app as a preview of a book and if I really want to dig in further I‚Äôll actually buy the book. But for the most part I get what I want to out of their summaries!
I enjoy how I can listen to so many great books summarized into roughly 15 minute ‚Äúpodcasts.‚Äù They are inspirational nuggets each day.
This has changed my life and inspired me to be great. I also never liked reading until I started using this app now I‚Äôm a bookworm
"I started the 7 day trial yesterday and less than 24 hr later I can‚Äôt access anything.
As a busy mum of 3 plus a full time job, I thought this would be perfect for me. I read one summary yesterday and enjoyed it so during a quick 15 min break thought I would read some more today. It has been saying loading content for the past 30 mins! So I can‚Äôt open anything to read whilst I have some spare time! What‚Äôs the point in that? It‚Äôs a time waster rather than a time saver.
Was also disappointed when the visual learning topics were an additional price."
"I love this app I even got an account for my son so he could advance himself with the best of best books at his fingertips and hear it if anything. 

I enjoy it and it‚Äôs a great reflection to keep track of books read or heard for sure!"
Listening to important business books in the car has given me the info I need in the time I have. I highly recommend this app for anyone on the go with little time to sit and read
Not at all what the ads claim. The ads show things that literally are not even a part of the app.
Often reading an entire book is repetitive and time consuming. Headway does a great job to summarize key points in a succinct way! It‚Äôs very helpful and motivating.
Great books !!
I always felt so unmotivated prior to this app. After installing it, I felt the difference in attitude, habit, and info all around me. Makes me feel like I‚Äôm actually improving myself overtime. The amount of time you can read a day is amazing and convenient. I highly recommend for anyone wanting a change in their life. There‚Äôs something for everyone!
5 Stars
Headway! Is the direct-way! To get HEAD.
"I love listening and reading to the summaries each day. The content is so motivating and interesting. 

The reason for 3 stars though is because I started using this app without creating an account. After listening to a few book summaries and bookmarking and highlighting content, I was very disappointed when my activity wasn‚Äôt transferred over when I logged in/created an account. I really like the book summaries that were recommended to me in the past week and now feel like my algorithm isn‚Äôt the same anymore.

This is definitely a unique app that will help you learn and grow. I highly recommend it but make sure to create an account when you start üò©"
Great job üëè
Headway is perfect for my ride to work in the morning. It teaches me about a Subject of my choice in 30 minutes or less. I then can walk into my office with my head held high and be very confident Headway is a game changer a life changer try it
The daily reads are definitely a motivator for me.  Having a short, fulfilling read daily is quick and enjoyable break to the overwhelming duties of a fast paced life.
This book helps couples start to develop healthy habits that bring them back together.
So far, I read three summaries and all were wonderfully informative, carefully capturing the main points of the book. This gives the reader the bottom line up front allowing the reader to digest the topic while not spending time on the ‚Äúfluff‚Äù in a book. However, should the reader decide to go read the full document they will have a well rounded understanding of the underlying fundamentals of the work.
I tried other book summary app but this is by far the best one. Recall of important key points from the book is important and Headway easily achieves this with the flash cards
The voices for all of the audios I‚Äôve listened to are all robots and it distracts from the content.
This app has all the perks to learn to improve yourself. Great learning and motivation!!
I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs legal to charge at the start of your trial. I saw an ad and thought the app was cool. I decided to try and do a free trial to get the feel of the app. Nope I was charged up front for the subscription. I have reached out to Apple and hopefully I get a refund because this is ridiculous. I‚Äôve seen a couple of people have this problem too. Should have read the reviews before downloading smh.
Variety of topics. books that are extremely beneficial and powerful. Knowledge is key. Highly recommended. Helps in many aspects of life
I saw the ad on instagram and decided it was worth a try, did the 7 day trial and I‚Äôve definitely started reading more. Very informative as well many different topics to read from!!
Definitely be an interesting person in the room.  But more than that be a better version of you.
Way to expensive for what you get.Not a bad app overall, just needs to be more affordable.
This app recommends book summaries based on a personality test you take initially. I‚Äôve really enjoyed this app so far (1 month in)
Good summary of a book. For example, I have read atomic habits and listened/read the summary from headway. The summary had the same or similar message that I got from the book, but only spending 15 min to read. You can‚Äôt replace the value of the book, but with everybody being busy nowadays, this is a good way to get the valuable info from the book without spending 8-9 hours reading. I suggest reading the summary, then if you like it, read the book. I like how you can read and listen at the same time.
Tried the app for a few weeks, but shortly after subscribing it quit loading.  Finally got tired of trying and deleted it.  Content was ok when it worked.
Seen an ad on Instagram thought to give it a try and well, I have to say it was a really good decision in retrospect and would strongly recommend if you wish to focus on improving your skills in certain departments
üëç
First, a summary is usually a good way to know whether you'd like to read a book, which is free when you are actually interested in buying one, which makes this app obsolete and borderline dangerous. Having people believe they are actually reading content and learning here is a rip off. Authors must agree to put material on there in the hopes of selling, I don't see why they would  otherwise. Second, the content of those books is very conservative. Very disappointed. I read 3 book summaries and all 3 were trash. No thanks!
Great tool to get informed and have more meaningful conversations - without committing to lengthy read.
This reading is very informational & great ! I loved it
Very bite-size information straight to the point, but affordable nonetheless.
Headway has made it much easier to get the maid points from books without having to read the whole book or skim them yourself. Since I‚Äôve been using headway for the book summaries I‚Äôve been able to manage my time better all while getting the knowledge I‚Äôve been seeking.
Seriously just use it!
Helps to reframe the mind in a positive, stimulating, and fun way! It‚Äôs a pleasurable addition to my daily walk that has promoted a lot of happiness.
Headway is tailored to what you are interested in. They have great suggestions and challenges that suite your goals. Instead of scrolling you can use Headway; and dive into something your actually interested in.
App is great. Not much more to say
With merely 10 minutes a day, my knowledge and self improvement grows exponentially!
Excelente y acertado el libro
I got this app because I thought that I would have access to some things even if there was a premium option, but no. I have to pay for everything. I will be ordering the books I‚Äôm interested in on Amazon, this app was definitely not worth my time. I would recommend creating a free option or at least telling people they cannot do ANYTHING without paying for it. Would have never gotten this app if I knew üëé.
It says you can listen to some books for free but you cannot unless you sign up. It shows a book available but there‚Äôs no way to play it without subscribing. Seems like a great concept but I can‚Äôt try it out so I‚Äôm not going to give them any money. Just buy the real books and support the authors directly. At least you can read or listen to them at your leisure.
Just love it
I like the concept & was drawn to it as I love podcasts and audiobooks. It turned out I didn‚Äôt end up using this that much. I assumed it could cancel any time & no big deal. You can‚Äôt cancel after you‚Äôve been billed for the year & full amount. I tried and was told they wouldn‚Äôt renew my membership but a prorated refund is out of the question. This was a terrible policy outside of market standards and led to an extremely negative experience where I would never try this again because it‚Äôs too much to commit to. I hope they make changes, otherwise proceed with caution!
I‚Äôm a huge fan of this app.  I‚Äôve put reading these synopsis‚Äô into my daily journal routine.  The insights add awesome and the conclusions/summary‚Äôs make it all easy to understand.
The contents of this app have greatly helped light a fire in my soul. As crazy as it sounds reading some of these publications have incredibly helped my ability to maintain a good positive outlook on the topic at hand. Knowledge doesn‚Äôt have to be boring and you don‚Äôt have to hang onto every word but when you truly have read something that matters individually to you it‚Äôll be easy to retain.
Two words: Life Changing!
The syntheses of books are super handy - they‚Äôre quick to go through and cover the most important points. Self help books are notoriously mired with a ton of filler, making them a poor use of time. Summaries are a great antidote to this problem!
Worth $
love the app
I like the headway app because it is interesting, informative, positive, helpful and fun! Thank you‚Ä¶üòä
It is nice to contemplate such affirmations, hearing them articulated and put into words, as to regard one‚Äôs self as an observer
"After reading a few summaries I kept wondering if the content I was reading was accurate with the authors full intent or merely an interpretation of it.  So I decided to read a couple summaries of books I had not just read but studied thoroughly. It is my opinion now that these summaries are highly biased.  The attempt to apologize for any content not in line with ultra left political views.  I consider myself moderate but found myself wondering if I was listening to summaries or a critique.  
I guess that‚Äôs fine, but don‚Äôt market to me like your a  shorten version of the real books.  If I wanted an opinion I would listen to a podcast.  
If you want a book filtered by you most left leaning friend Headway is for you.  Otherwise buy the cliff notes"
The app crashes every minute. Looks like it would be a good app. I haven‚Äôt been able to use it because it won‚Äôt stop crashing.
I love listening to motivational and inspirational books while I‚Äôm doing things that I don‚Äôt like doing- cleaning/laundry. It gives me drive even in the little things; when I can change my perspective on the little thing, the big goals I‚Äôm tackling seem more manageable! Love this app!
They trick you into their up sells without disclosing costs and then when you contact them about this fraud, they tell you that their policy is no refunds, no exceptions.
I feel like I‚Äôm getting the quick version of a topic over a cup of coffee with a friend. What a wonderful way to take in new topics and ideas.
Has potential but not as good as I hoped it would be. Some of the intelligence quiz material is highly questionable and potentially triggering and as far as I can tell cannot be skipped over to get to the next level.
Love it! You initially take an intelligence test and it explains your results thoroughly. They have very popular books that are very well summarized (ex. Rich dad poor dad, the 7 habits, etc.) They have friendly challenges to increase your focus, creativity, productivity, wealth, etc. Overall a good investment if you‚Äôre looking for some personal growth but don‚Äôt have time for or (in my case) hate reading. I love being able to listen on my commute or breaks at work, it‚Äôs very motivating and tailored towards what you want to learn about. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm reading without having to actually read!
I love this app enough said!
It‚Äôs a great way to break out of the mold playing a stupid merge game or peddling away short videos on social media. The summaries bring some fun facts of life to light and every once in a while smack you with a great seed of actionable knowledge.
"The second day I had it, it wouldn‚Äôt open. Kept throwing an error message and then would completely shut down. Tried restarting my phone and redownloading app. No luck. 
I would experience the same error / shut down when trying to reach customer service."
Headway helps provide valuable summaries for books and ideas to people that don‚Äôt have the time to read them front to back. Hopefully their catalog will continue to increase with time, but there‚Äôs plenty to digest and go through currently. A great resource at a great price that provides simple values. Next time I‚Äôm waiting in line, I remember to whip out Headway to invest in myself rather than doom-scroll with nothing to show for it at the end.
5 stars, 5 stars
The app means well. The initial free trial period happens and then you are pushed immediately into a automatic 1 year subscription and charged. If you want to request a refund, the app directs you to Apple, and it‚Äôs a dead end. There is no direct contact for support. Do not get. Not worth it.
so I am 23 and entrepreneur, I don‚Äôt believe I have ever written a review from the App Store and I‚Äôve had an iPhone as long as I can remember. I strongly recommend you take the test and read these books every day life can kind of get away from us and this is an excellent reminder to read. I love to read a good book, and this is that and more. I feel a deeper connection within myself as I truly ponder how I can apply the concept this app teaches me. Also, if you take their intuition test at the end of it, they will give you 70% off and it‚Äôs only $30 a year so I highly recommend it and would even pay the original price as I have found great value in an app that actually makes a difference with how I live my life. and this is coming from somebody who doesn‚Äôt like to be on their phone by the way.
I listen to the books as I go to sleep. I love that they have the books summarized so they are quick listens.
Reading this way is simple and easy. Fast way to learn and extremely inspirational
"I have only recently began using Headway, but I am already very pleased with it. Simple layout, good(even if not fully agreeable) books that make you consider things more deeply, all the while being read by a reasonably well-spoken narrator.

On Stacksocial you can get a lifetime account currently for $59.00, which, to me, is well worth it.

Hopefully more are able to come to the app and enjoy it as well, and may the team behind the app continue to add and improve on the app over time. Perhaps incentivize streaks more by adding rewards such as a one-choice infographic for X number of days of using the app. Would be nice for those who choose to use the app on the daily but are not keen on spending money on the full infographic bundle."
"So fabulous! You need this app! Seriously - I challenge you to sit in the sunshine while listening to a book summary at least once a week, it‚Äôs an instant mood booster!
I love headway because I have a reading list that‚Äôs a million miles long, and while with the free version I don‚Äôt get to choose which book I get for free, I love the easy access to learning and it inspires me to want to read more in my free time. 
Highly recommend!"
How is this app 5 stars as a ‚Äúfree app‚Äù when it‚Äôs literally unusable without paying?
It‚Äôs a great app with great books fool of amazing information‚ÄºÔ∏è
You make me spend like 10 minutes on a survey when I open the app, and then ask for $20 to see the results? Not cool
Like the app, but hate that it only works in Portrait Mode on the ipad.
I love the convenience of the shirt summaries. It is wonderful to literally read a book a day or multiple in a day!
Give the 7 day free trial a shot. You‚Äôll love it.
"It‚Äôs easy to to listen to and gives a quick punch packed with great insights to better. 

Sometimes the commitment to a whole book can be overwhelming. Having an app give a synopsis in 15 minutes allows readers to decide which book they want to invest their time in while also bringing valuable information to the listener."
Beware of some of the publications about finances. If you are strict on your habits of wealth, most of these publications are about how to retire and set things up for retirement.
I like it don‚Äôt cut corners get straight to the point that‚Äôs how I like
Simplemente excelentes res√∫menes !!
It is always asking you for money all the time for every single book you try to read or listen to
I bought a 1 year subscription, in the beginning Everything was great! I love love lives the app!! Then I could not use my app correctly. The books wouldn‚Äôt work, the app would t load. It was so frustrating. I would delete the app and reinstall NOTHING.!! I Literally paid a year subscription for 2 month‚Äôs worth of content. I feel so dumb.
I started Headway today. I'm so impressed with this app. It's very different than other self help apps that I've used in the past. Looking forward to my next session.
"I utilized the free trial then was sure to cancel by the date given. I am very good about these things and had a reminder in my calendar to cancel
In time. I now see that I am being charged for an $89 subscription! I emailed the company several times and have gotten no reply."
Loving the app highly recommended it
I love this app!!
Summary is excellent to review the key points!
Every time I get the urge to scroll on social media instead I will open this app.  When reading a book what stays with me are high level points so this app is a standout way of allowing me to dip into many different viewpoints, ideas and concepts.  It‚Äôs like a mentor in my pocket.  Thanks for having an audio feature I can even listen to it while driving!
Love this!
Definitely eye opening, This app was well needed! Has short story‚Äôs, but tell a lot and help with everyday life. Helps on focus, anxiety, building mindset etc. literally a book on anything :)
I love listening while getting off work
I don‚Äôt even had the chance to see what the app is about. I‚Äôve been bombarded with messages asking to pay. It says $59 then says ‚Äúwe have a promotion, $29 now. And every tab I clicked that page popped up asking to subscribe. I possibly would if I had the chance to see a little bit of the app, but I couldn‚Äôt so I‚Äôm deleting it.
Pop in the the ear buds and hit play for an easy way to learn! The summaries provide just enough info for me to determine if I want to learn more or take a pass.
"I love this app. I had been trying to make it a habit to not reach out for my phone as soon as I woke up cos I didn‚Äôt want to start my day with social media and overload of unwanted information. 
Now I get my daily dose of reading through Headway app it‚Äôs quick precise and to the point. I have come across some interesting books and I get to finish them in a few minutes. Highly recommend."
So, really like this app and the cost. However, I would like to see landscape mode on iPad. Hope more titles and challenges are coming!!
Reads the books to me
I like the summary format but find the depth of books to choose from to be lacking. On many attempts, performing garden variety topic searches yielded no results.
I‚Äôm impressed!  The summaries I‚Äôve read are interesting and thought provoking.  Thumbs up!
If you want to find the key points of books within 10-15 minutes. This is for you. I would still rather read a book, but for those books that you just need to quickly get out of the way and get to the points, this works perfectly.
I‚Äôve read some of the books shown here, and seeing all these highlights and insights help me review all the material read and make it my own in the long term. Highly recommended!
I love this app. I really enjoy learning and improving myself but don‚Äôt have the time to read full books. I feel like I normally only take a handful of things from books anyway so these summaries help you get to those handful of things right away.
I‚Äôve enjoyed listening to books this way.
This app really boosts up my brain and helps me optimize my life!
"I love to read but I do not like feeling like I‚Äôm being scammed. The offer was for. 7 day trial. I selected the option for the trial with a potential to sign up for 3 months of service at approximately $39 after the 7 days. At sign up, I was charged $39 plus tax. I want a refund now !!!! Unfortunately, Apple customer service says the wait for a decision is 48 hours. 

This feels pretty scammy and for that reason I don‚Äôt want the service!! Buyer Beware"
Great way to learn quickly and conveniently! I‚Äôm taking the 28 day financial challenge. I‚Äôd never have the time to get through all these great books. Plus, the app provides excellent summaries.
If it wasn‚Äôt for the constant frustration of having to close and reopen the app after every selection in order to interact with the app again it would be much higher rated for me. I am on Apple iOS. Need to fix the glitches so a user can select another book after the current one without having to close the app.
Love it very awsome!!!
I am loving the convenience of the put together options of interest. Based on the quiz. I am pleased with the selection that was chosen.
The app was awesome and thoroughly enjoyed using to daily getting snippets and main thoughts of so many positive, inspirational books. Yet, as of the last two weeks when I have the time to go into the app it immediately crashes. It was working shortly after but now I have not been able to access it for a week.
The title, reading daily has made me a better at my career and personal life.
Deliverers information in an easy and to the point way. Easy to consume tailored content for my self improvement.
Blessings forever who need to more bout that read stuff it‚Äôs so far üìïüíØ
I have picked up some very useful tips ; just from a few books. I think this is a very helpful way also for anyone with visual issues also trying to head into a better understanding of the world around them.
It describes all these great books in a short informative summary! I think it‚Äôs awesome!!!
I love this because it reminds me to read more.
Headway is great for busy individuals who crave mindset growth as it provides knowledge from popular titles in bite sized chunks that are easy to read and impactful.
Amazing app easy to use!
"You need this app unless you are someone who reads a book a week.  That is a rare person indeed. 

This app will take the best of books and distill them into nuggets of gold that will enrich your life.  Have you ever noticed that the most accomplished people in the world are also voracious readers? This app is a cheat that will get you closer to being a person who is a voracious reader bit without the burdensome time commitment.  

This app is akin to what doing 10 minutes of burpees would do for your body - 10 minutes in this app does likewise for your mind."
The App is so user friendly. It provides great information and in such an easy to understand way! I will be using this app and look forward to learning more from their books as often as possible!
This is a great app to use I use it when I m getting ready in the morning at it helps wake me up and get motivated
Informative and inspiring app of books
Not paying for this. I‚Äôll do my learning for free thanks but NO Thanks!!
I didn‚Äôt get why this app kept being advertised to me and didn‚Äôt understand what it was for the longest time but I‚Äôm glad I tried it. I can‚Äôt finish a book to save my life lately but I love reading and making myself think and these summaries are the perfect length.
Why would you waste 5 precious minutes of my life taking this test just to NOT get my results? üòê I just wanna know my type and then decide if I wanna buy what you‚Äôre selling lol.
I enjoy using Headway because it has tons of information that you can easily digest. Since the summaries are brief you can easily come back to brush up on something you‚Äôve already learned just to make sure it sticks!
In today‚Äôs world, we rarely have time. Between our jobs, our families are social obligations, when do we have time to grow and develop ourselves? Headway is an excellent app that gives you that time it gives you those little snippets of information that you need to direct your focus in on your life. Headway gives you a chance to find out the meat of a book that you might want to purchase and read or listen to in-depth without wasting a lot of time trying to figure out is this book for me? I highly recommend the app.
Best app out there for summaries.
Not inform it is paid before the installation and survey.
"The app itself is decent however there‚Äôs this one dude who has a very annoying accent (sounds like he‚Äôs from Minnesota) when speaking as well as being borderline robo.

To get more people to enjoy your app:
Give an option (or two) to choose between multiple narrators for a given book. I‚Äôve been avoiding books entirely because of the ‚ÄòWis-kahn-sen‚Äô guy‚Äôs accent. 

I know there are multiple books to get through but it feels like the narrators are rushing through these. You need pepper cadence and intonation. The quality of this is basically the biggest draw or drawback for this form of information absorption.

The concept is good but it leaves much to be desired. Hire someone with a neutral accent, with a weighty/soothing voice."
this is exactly why they started burning books in fahrenheit 451. people started getting little pamphlets of a summary of classic books just to seems smarter to their friends and it got to a point where society couldn‚Äôt handle all the fake knowledge and new ideas so they started burning books. also you have to pay to actually make this app worth it but god please don‚Äôt let it get to you. we‚Äôre already half way to the real story of fahrenheit 451 don't let us get the rest of the way. also you really can‚Äôt get a good idea from a book in a 15 minute summary that‚Äôs just ridiculous. you can‚Äôt get the full ideas from the book without reading it.
10/10
Love this app! I recommend using and using in app purchases
For some reason I thought apps like these were all gimmickry when asking for money, but honestly it‚Äôs really helped me understand things about myself and try to find solutions in small bites.
Pretty good so far as I use the free trial and I think I‚Äôll consider purchasing
So far so good.
"Seemed like it would be similar to Blinkist but with some added features. Blinkist is something like $100 per year I believe, but well worth it. Headway said it would be $60 per year, and one of the features was the visual summaries. 

Got the free trial, used for 5 minutes. Visual summaries are an additional purchase, not part of the subscription. Book summaries are read by AI, and not very good AI. 

If you like this concept, just spend the extra money on Blinkist. Huge library of book summaries read by engaging voice actors and very focused on bringing you the actionable portions of books on self-improvement (among other topics)."
I‚Äôm enjoying what I‚Äôm learning on headway.each summary comes with quotes at the end which you can save to help you remember key points. You can listen or read, I‚Äôve found that reading puts me to sleep before I can finish but the listening feature keeps me engaged and I can finish in a brief amount of time if not one session.
It‚Äôs expensive so I just get the free daily book.
this app completely knocks it out of the park and for the price I‚Äôve spent thousands on the books for $39.99 or $79.99. I‚Äôm saving money and getting everything and all of the books that I‚Äôve been wanting to buy but I don‚Äôt have time to read. I can listen to them when I drive, read them at night apply them to my life, my favorite authors, I mean you name this Hass to be the best app I‚Äôve ever invested in and probably the best investment I‚Äôve made in myself because I can guarantee you the return that I get back from this app which I‚Äôve already experiencing now so far definitely far outweighs the return I get back if I had to purchase as well as read every individual book it saves me time tons of time and gives me the meat and potatoes of all of the box as well as saves me a substantial amount of money so with that being said, I can take the money I‚Äôm saving and invested back into myself and my life, while at the same time using the tips and the methods and the techniques that I‚Äôm learning from the summaries the books the audiobooks I mean I can‚Äôt say enough about this app. It‚Äôs absolutely unbelievable. I‚Äôve shared it with every person I know I‚Äôm telling you buy this app you won‚Äôt regret it. In fact, you‚Äôll be so grateful that you did because in a matter of a day watch how your attitude your routines, yourself discipline all of that will begin to change and you‚Äôre right, you‚Äôll gain momentum. This app has motivated me into actually taking action. This is outstanding best app ever and honestly whoever came up with is my app is an absolute genius kudos my gratitude definitely goes out and I‚Äôm only on my first week free trial and I‚Äôm certainly going to purchase this app annually. Now that I have it, I can‚Äôt even imagine living without it.
Headway is great any many ways to achieve anything you can think of from self-confidence, to business tips to being more self-controlled to being more masculine headway has it all making it an efficient and successful app for self-improvement
Great app straight to the point. Love the key points and the ability to set quotes to remember
Smart. Amazing. Easy to read
I‚Äôve only had the app a little over a week and I have been sharing my experiences with my family and friends. I‚Äôm excited to have a resource such as this to help me with my own personal journey on many different levels. The app is great for me because I have dyslexia and the ability to listen to the material allows me to retain and process the information so much more efficiently. Super excited to see the results. I‚Äôll check back in and report back to you in about two months.
"First off the app barely works. Most of the time the audio versions are just an automated voice reading and they never load properly unless you download them. The ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù don‚Äôt register and the options for articles are disappointing.
What really got me though was the straight up lie about the free trial. They said they would notify me before charging me after the free trial. This never happened and they charged me for a full year. Now, there is no way to contact their customer service or delete my subscription. This is a classic trap subscription and I feel like an idiot to have fallen for it."
"I‚Äôve had this app for a week‚Äîand let‚Äôs just say I am now considering ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù in myself.  I love how content is curated based on your identified interests and time you can dedicate.  I find that I am spending more than the 15mins/day I allocated as the content/options to read/listen to are pretty noteworthy.

There‚Äôs something for everyone, and even if you can only carve out 5 mins/day for self-improvement and motivation, you‚Äôll find yourself building/dedicating more time than you think!"
"I‚Äôm a full time mommy with a four year old and a five month old, so finding time for self improvement and growth can be challenging. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to shower without interruptions let alone finish a book unless it‚Äôs from the children‚Äôs bookcase. 
Headway makes it possible to learn about all the subjects I want in small doses that fit practically into my busy day. 
At a time in my life when I felt stuck, headway gave me the tools I needed to take baby steps toward my goals. Little bits of progress have motivated me to keep chipping away every day!"
Great app, daily options of audio books that are timely and helpful! Great investment to your life !
This format and its readability are far above any other apps I‚Äôve tried. It‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre invested in the UX and I hope it continues to grow and be amazing!
Downloaded from an ad as it seems to market itself as a good app for self growth but they‚Äôre going to charge me for that growth
This is great
this app will only do as much good for you as you want it to. there really isn‚Äôt a limit, but it gets you started in the right direction
Claim they have no record of my email.
I love the book üìï summaries and how it is easily accessible and digestible!!
I love this app and how it summarizes books.
Amazing app
Everything is behind a paywall and won‚Äôt tell you until you already compete the survey. After results are calculated, you need to pay at least $19.99 to access them. I find this to be highly deceptive - the app should communicate cost before collecting personal information.
This app is something I can be passionate about. Focused direction on specific areas I strive to improve in sounds mundane but not with this app. Love! Love! Love!üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è
So I know a lot of these reviews complain about the charge for the subscription. I kinda was a little confused but understood most of the deal I bought it thinking it would only charge a certain amount however it did charge more. But later realized that was so worth it. I‚Äôve grown a lot even as a 17 year old I never thought I would be writing a review like this but it‚Äôs a good app. Basically even if it asks for money dude that bih is so worth it you‚Äôll be glad you bought it. And no I am not an IA or computer writing this I‚Äôm just keeping it a 100 to be helpful to other people. :)
I have had this subscription for 3 days, have used it for 3 days. I stand by my choice.
Love adding this to my morning routine to inspire and create intentional learning
This app is able to consolidate a ton of information in easily digestible bites that leave you with thought provoking concepts and prompts for how you want to grow as a person.
3 days in and I love it so far. Great info, and easy way for self improvement!
Love the high level cliff notes view that gets to the point and cuts out some of the fluff.  Easy to read in the AM before starting the day instead of scrolling through social media channels that are distracting (still save a few mins for funny /cute animal videos).
"This app has some of the best summaries that are straight to the point. 
I just wish there were available on Mac/Windows!"
Don‚Äôt support country that was killing Russian speaking people for over 8y.
I am becoming a better person
When I click on the app on my iPhone a message comes up that says unexpected error and the app disappears please help I started right after I think the last update thank you for your help
I just wanted to take a personality test. You cannot get the results without subscribing or paying some amount
After signup, the "congratulations, Ace" is a sure turnoff.  Who, who isn't a tool, calls someone "Ace"?         Got it, Sporto?  Know where I'm coming from, Chief?        Later, Pal.
it‚Äôs really simple and you can set little goals, like I set a goal to take 20 minutes of my day at least to sit and listen to the books they have available! Currently on my 7 day free trial and will most likely get a subscription!
Love the app- big growth mentality kind of guy but also get lazy like anyone else‚Ä¶ i want to sleep at the end of a busy day not read for 30 minutes to get one lesson‚Ä¶ these straight to the point breakdowns leave me with the same inspired feeling i get from seminars and public speakers. The intentional delivery of the topics and lessons to be learned allow me to absorb all of the necessary info and carry it with me into the next days. So far i have primarily read Motivation, Self-Discipline, communication and relationship centered books! Hope this review helps- they know the 7 day trial will hook you but for this ‚Äúpower-reader‚Äù im glad it worked!
More of a novelty. Grew bored after a day.
The content is great with lots of options, but I deducted one star for the female narrator voice. It‚Äôs so robotic and monotone and it makes it really tough to get through.
I love this app for the customization toward your goals, concise and helpful book summaries, and tools that are helping improve my life already! Highly recommend.
Day one and I already have tools that I can apply!

Love this app, can read so much more and get information faster than ever, love this app!
Awesome!!
i spent $60 on this app, and it crashes constantly, is practically unusable
Absolutely obsessed, I‚Äôve been reading a 10 page summary every night before bed and it‚Äôs officially a habit. Super informative, educational, and motivational. I haven‚Äôt even tapped into all the features this app has yet. WAY worth the money and I don‚Äôt pay for anyyyyyyy apps. Just do it.
I would keep on doing this more but I can‚Äôt pay for this, I‚Äôm only using the 7day free trial
Honestly I‚Äôm not a big reader person, but this book has allowed me to find books that will actually help me to become a better person AND my attention span has increased so much thanks to these readings. I believe thanks to this app (and God and therapy) has helped me to look at life different and be more positive in life! (Ps they had a sale where you pay 29.99 the whole year which I personally think it‚Äôs better than $$50 I think? So hopefully they still have that promotion! $30 bucks spent well)
It gives you the opportunity to gain knowledge and still have time.
I purchased this app because I thought it would be similar to listening to an audio book, but just a condensed version of some bestselling books. The concept is brilliant, but most of the books are delivered in a painfully monotone automated voice. It makes for a really unpleasant listening experience, and if I could get a refund I would. It‚Äôs unfortunate, bc if Headway would invest minimal dollars into an actual person reading the summaries, I would recommend it to everyone. Disappointed. :(
I love to read, but once in a while it good to get a brief summary if a good book. It usually gives me more clarity of wether or not to read the whole book. I‚Äôve learned a lot using Headway and the reminder cards are super useful in helping me retain the valuable nuggets I find in each book. Highly recommend it!
Highly refined this app if you are dealing with change or seeking to move away from thinking errors
"This app is magic - I‚Äôm a bookworm and love all the books I can get my hands on but there‚Äôs not enough time. This app helps me read the best parts of hundreds of books on a daily basis and helps me select which books are a must read in their entirety. 
Highly recommend! Always feeding my brain and always growing is made easy w this app."
I paid for the $39.99 subscription and gave it a shot but the summaries are quite disjointed and not a good read. For certain nonfiction case study type summaries, they start the thread and then never conclude the story.
"I‚Äôm the kind of person that is always curious about what else can I lear, and this app let me explore many books without the commitment of more than 15min a day
I simply Love it"
If you want to improve your life or work on yourself, development, relationships, career, habits, whatever the case may be, then, this is absolutely a must have app. It‚Äôs quick it‚Äôs efficient and to the point which is exactly why I love it. It holds my attention, and there‚Äôs a plethora of variety to choose from for everybody. Get the app.
Awesome books and valuable information 100% recommended.
My daily supplement of added intelligence and personal growth in a 15 min time capsule.
Really love this app! I always get lost in the fluff of books. With this app, it‚Äôs straight to the points. You can learn and read fast!
They will take your money. They won‚Äôt give it back and apple is complicit in this scam as they burn income. Robot narration of AI summaries. Absolute waste of my time and money. Doesn‚Äôt load after this update and it‚Äôs FULL of trackers. I can‚Äôt even list them all but this is either Russian spyware or some other cover. Full of books on why antifa is bad, etc. App made by Russians to cause dissent. Gross. Apple and the devs wouldn‚Äôt refund me. I‚Äôm going to get my money back. Mark my words.
Yes, go add and subscribe it's the best!
I am so happy to have this app, because help me to improve me English. It is easy, and directly at the point.
Honestly amazing
Helps with being focused
I love this app. I used to sit down and read personal and professional growth books. Half way through, I always thought I got what I needed and would get bored. But I kept reading as I can‚Äôt not finish something I started. This app allows me to focus on what I need to and bounce back and forth on topics to match my needs. It‚Äôs incredible. I‚Äôll be gifting subscriptions to everyone in my circle.
Some of the summaries are horrible. I can never listen to the readers because they don‚Äôt have good reading tones. I like the app overall, but easily replaceable
This app is not free
"I signed up for the free trial to see what it was about, then I cancelled within an hour - like everyone else here / via the settings > subscriptions on my iPhone - but they continued to bill my PayPal!! When I reached out to support for a refund, the email no longer exists and bounced back. 

BEWARE- cancelling via the iPhone settings doesn‚Äôt work, you have to redownload the app, look through your account, find the subscription and cancel THERE!! I‚Äôve been purchasing apps for over 15 years and have never seen such a loophole."
Will charge you an annual fee. Over $90. If you cancel the ‚Äútrial‚Äù you still get charged. Apple App Store is also fraudulent and makes refunds impossible.  Gives you very little content.  Just a short and very basic synopsis of the books.  Nothing of value that couldn‚Äôt be gained from the back cover
Everything you need to be motivate, to learn & to self improves is all here. I actually do appreciate the reminders because otherwise this wouldn‚Äôt work for me. Thank you
Awesome great books.. love the reviews!!
This is a fine app to identify books you‚Äôd like to take a deep dive into.  Don‚Äôt think if this Cliff‚Äôs Notes approach as the end of your learning journeys, but a beginning.
The selections are on point and the summaries are excellent! I listen while I walk my pup üê∂ and have in turn, ordered a few selections! REALLY loving the app, it‚Äôs layout, daily selections and features!
"I haven't been using Headway for long, but I quickly realized that it keeps me from ignoring all those books I'll read ""someday."" I don't read nearly as much as I'd hoped I would. And though I used to read only fiction, my interest in nonfiction has deepened --probably because I need that information to find my way through challenging (and downright crappy) situations. 
One point off for the automated voice; I can only listen for limited time periods to a machine. 
But I find I'm stretching that time to take in more of the great books offered here!"
only read one of the books and i was instantly hooked. learned so much in just a few minutes of reading. highly recommend if you are looking to gain knowledge
The app it‚Äôs so easy to use. I use it while driving or cooking and is great. I love the fact that the chapters are short, so you can finish them quickly. Very knowledgeable.
Love getting the highlighted version of books. With adhd and two small kids, reading just doesn‚Äôt happen. This has completely changed the game. Now I‚Äôm getting to read and learn while not being overwhelmed by having to finish the book!
I love this app sometimes reading can be pretty hard for me to stay focused. So I love the how you can listen and read a long. They have a bunch of different books to learn from each day. I will continue to use this because of how much value it brings!
I really enjoy so far! 2 day streak!
I love listening to the book summaries. Valuable knowledge in the perfect size.
Truly helps fitting in that extra reading time I never knew I needed
"Many ads for this which shown fun and interactive tests to get your foot in the door.

They let you go through the entire quiz before telling you to pay $19 a month to access the results and other features. Be honest and lock your survey before users can enter data if you‚Äôre trying to gamify things. 

Might be a cool app but I will never download a product from this company following this annoying and dishonest marketing ploy."
"I think Headway is a cool concept. I used the trial but didn‚Äôt get to see much other than it reading books to me and the ability to save quotes. The IQ test was brief but the results seem decent. I can‚Äôt figure out what the next steps are, though, aside from reading books it suggests for me. I don‚Äôt see any other aspect of this app. 

Couple of problems that I have are‚Ä¶ I subscribed for the year and was not given the $49.99 promotional price. They charged me $59.99 instead. I reached out to customer support and they told me to go to apple instead. I have a screenshot to prove this. 

Secondly by subscribing you do not get full access to this app. Once I was charged for the yearly subscription, it is still prompting me to purchase other aspects of the app for an additional fee of $19.99. I was pretty shocked by this, and quite turned off.  Why pay for a full years subscription if it does not include all context on the app!? I‚Äôm not paying another twenty bucks on top of what I‚Äôve already paid. I think this is misleading and intend to reach out to apple support to address the issue. I emailed Headway as well so if they respond I will update."
I like having the summary of so many books for information. And if you want to dig deeper on a subject you can research it for yourself.
Great UI UX, simple and easy to understand. Highly recommended to people that like reading but don‚Äôt have the time
Online ads made this seem like a sexuality assessment app but it‚Äôs nothing like that. It‚Äôs nothing of the sort.
Great app!
It says free trial and they charged me right away.
"Listen parts are unnatural due to machine speaking. It should be human.

Also there‚Äôre UI blocking operations in app. Tapping buttons sometimes don‚Äôt work or it takes time. UI is good UX also good but programming is lacking of threading."

The reminders also keeps me up to go back to the books I did not finish and also reach my daily goals. Having read 5 books‚Äô summaries in 3 days and learnt a lot, I can say that I have already got my pennies worth for this month. But will continue to match my daily goals, nice app just would like the app icon color to be more professional.
The in-app purchasing price aren‚Äôt that cheap, but if you urge to read more books with limited daily  time in your hand then this might be the solution. You can cancel any time if you stop using it. Worth a try I would say.

This application is perfect for readers who wants to read books but doesn‚Äôt have time or if you‚Äôre thinking of buying a book but doesn‚Äôt want to spend money and thinking if in the end feel unsatisfied. Being able to have an insight or summary on a particular books gives the reader the opportunity to try it first if they will like it or not.

Very good content and you can get notification of great books in your break time
"Had an unpleasant experience of being charged after canceling a subscription through ‚ÄúSubscriptions‚Äù menu but not through the app itself. 
Support responded that there is no refund considered. Disappointed."
Muy buena aplicaci√≥n puedes escuchar y leer al mismo tiempo si deseas . Excelente!
At best, it‚Äôs a book review app. Great to quickly browse and listen to books you actually want to read.
The app for me would only let me listen to odd numbered chapters and never the even numbered chapters? Plus my phone had to be unlocked and open on the app to listen which isn‚Äôt very helpful at all.
I downloaded this as a way to help clear my mind and regain my focus in different parts of my life and this app has been a gateway to improving my mind body and spirit in ways I never thought I‚Äôd be able to
Love the app so far, pricing is fair for the service it provides. More content across the categories would be appreciated.
Signed up to give it a go on the free trial, but was charged ¬£60 during the signup process anyway. Then sent me multiple notifications a day, with no option to reduce - you either get as many as they deign to send you or you can turn notifications off and get none.
"I read the piece on motivation and ability it was a very informative read and easy and light hearted too. 
Exceptionally written as it encouraged and motivated me to continue to read till the end.
I didn‚Äôt want to stop because it wasn‚Äôt boring.
Well done I‚Äôm excited to continue reading 
Thank you for the information!"
Excellent app, never thought reading can be so easy! I am loving this app!
One of my best decisions to subscribe this app
"I saw a tweet that reading 20 minutes of non-fiction a day helps with personal development, and with the developed mindset you can achieve more. 
The same day Headway popped up as an ad. It interested me so I got it.
I have only read 2 books so far, they were enlightening, inspirational and to the point which provided focus, instead of beating round the bush and losing interest.
I hope this helps you, get reading."
Truss
I want to know so many things, but I don't have time to study them. With Headway, I DO!
I‚Äôm happy for having found it! Thank you so much!
This got advertised as a free app, although after being asked about 15 questions THEN they decide to bring in payment- weekly, monthly or yearly and special deals- piss off
Noice
Good summaries of well chosen books for busy people.
I don‚Äôt get much time to read so this app is perfect. In the last few months I have listened to 80 summaries and they are brilliantly written. If you are even just slightly tempted I recommend giving the free trial a go
It‚Äôs a shame on the free trial you only get a summery of books on the daily reads
"Everything that is written is absolutely motivating! 
Just try the app and change your mindset üòä"
Very well known popular books summarised for you to read when convenient for you. A fantastic idea and such well written summaries. Makes me more excited to buy the books!
Easy to read
"From the first two books that I read it give‚Äôs you the feeling of being on the right thing to do and not only  I think that it widens your way of thinking and in the same time the way you react with people. 
Everyone should try and see for himself how the readings  in this app it‚Äôs going to help, individually it will be different for each person. Just my opinion tough."
"I love this way of reading effortlessly 
And knowing more about thing that passionate me in my limited time."
Headway cuts through the noise to give the most concise information on pretty much everything that can help inspire a better life. Some days I feel like Jonny 5!
It made me start to read!
I listen to at least one summary on headway every morning, it energises and motivates me.
No single page is for free. I think it would be great if they could make short versions of books for free, although they charge for full versions.  I did not see any book any page for free. They have, No money no reading policy.  At least they have 7 days free trial. This was not something I expected so had to uninstall.
Great for anyone looking to use less of the social app, this should be the only app you should be on while using your phone ! Reading is fun-to-mental
I was put off continuing with this app after listening to some incredibly backwards views in one of the books. A better selection process is needed to capture a progressive audience.
Really gets to the point of a book quickly, no indulgent text or padding, and the book recommendations are spot on.
On my second day of trail and can‚Äôt stop reading ‚Ä¶
"I was very much looking forward to this.

The app keeps crashing. Took my money even though I signed up for a free trial and then still won‚Äôt work.

Waste of time. Just buy a real book!

Useless!"
"Great App- As you work through different books it‚Äôs not long until you start too use the useful information you have pined.

Straight to the point and cuts the bits which can get you to switch off.

Inspirational and motivational messages which can really better you as a person‚Äôs well being and successful future.

Just 10 to 15 minutes of your time not only to switch off and read but excellent information that will reall better you as a person 
Thanks 
Chris Jones"
Easy bite size info, full books need filler info this is the main points
Useful, enjoyable and reliable app on my phone.
On book 2 today, very informative, looking forward to tomorrows already
Literally the best books available and tailored to your needs and interests available audio so if you are busy you don‚Äôt need to read from the books it‚Äôs also sort of summaries Ed with most important points of the book I would advise you to get the app is worth it
Signed up for a free trial and automatically got charged a yearly subscription. Awful.
Amazing app, only recently discovered it but has helped with me saying things on a different point of view! A lot of motivational books which have changed my life in work and personal life! Would 100% recommend!
This is a great app for catching up on all the missed books one doesn‚Äôt find time but wants to be reading. I listen to most during dog walk with Bob.
Great app. Nice clear and understandable way to learn whatever you want even on the go :)
It is a positive life changing decision. Feels like waking up among great thinkers, getting advice n insights from their experience in under 20 minutes. Aspects that interest you can be extended by reading the full chapter. Really great tool to have.
the summaries are super punchy, short&sweet.
Amazing app and is a must to download. Helps you read more efficiently and for more longer hours, and it‚Äôs FREE!!!!
I have been listening to summaries for a week now, in the morning, when prepping for work. This is an easily accessible and efficient way to learn and or discover new things in your areas of interest.
I have downloaded a free trial didn‚Äôt like the app deleted it, but when signing the agreement they stated to send me a reminder when the app will finish free trial. I have lost my money now as there was no reminder sent and I don‚Äôt even like the app. It‚Äôs crap! their T&C say they‚Äôre not giving any customer service either... wonderful
Great app
I love the summary for most books - easy way to understand the key messages in important books when I don‚Äôt have the time to read.
This app has helped me so much , it has changed my mindset, answers all my questions, has given me so much advice and insight , love it .
Helps in daily reading and absorbing high content information from great minds. Really enjoy it. Thanks
I‚Äôm suffering majorly at the moment with a number of things. I accidentally brought this package! But I‚Äôm so glad I did.
Really accessible and inspiring to help make changes and improvements in our daily life
An ad on Instagram said download this to do the personality test. I can‚Äôt find the test in the app. It‚Äôs about books. Uninstalled it.
It‚Äôs very motivating, informative and inspiring customised to all the aspects of your life you want to work on and develop through. Would highly recommend! I loved it!
Great app to read books quickly and pick up the important details. Some of the books haven‚Äôt been to my taste but the information is good! I feel the price point might be a bit expensive on top of all my other subscriptions that‚Äôs all - having to prioritise my finances
It is impossible to cancel within the 7 days as the app‚Äôs functionality fails every time with just this feature.  No problem with Wifi or other apps.  Very suspicious.  I want to cancel as I don‚Äôt find the content useful to me but can‚Äôt cancel.  I will be contacting my bank as I am not the only one to have this problem.
I loved reading but for the last few years found it impossible to fit it in or concentrate . This app has given it back to me and I now read or listen to at least 3 books a day ! With no impact on my busy life . I highly recommend this .
I have endless books sitting bought with good intentions but unread on my shelves because I haven‚Äôt time to read them all. I know that they contain interesting and life changing information but life happens. Headway has helped me cherry pick the very best info and insights without the huge time investment of reading cover to cover. I am an annual subscriber now (previously monthly) and I imagine the app will save me a small fortune and gain me a head full of new things.
"headway is a the perfect app for you if your an avid reader like me but also have a tight
schedule. it takes the best self help books and turns them into 15 minute summaries that are easy to read or listen to on the train or on your way home from work. absolutely recommend!"
"Impossible to cancel, no answer apart from automatic message to unsubscribe but still blocked 
Waiting for urgent answer"
Downloaded this app as I had seen many ads on it and I thought I‚Äôd give it a try. Made my profile and went to ready the first book‚Ä¶.BOOM there‚Äôs a catch. You have to pay ¬£75+ a year for their silly subscription to be able to read any book. You can‚Äôt even select a book and read it free of charge as you keep getting a prompt to pay using Apple Pay. Uninstalled the app and moved to a free version of this which works much better and has no ads/annoys prompts come up.
Short bursts of learning and reminders. Great self growth tool for busy lives
‚úÖ‚úÖüî•
Very good
I love the daily challenge. It gives me the push I need, to create time out of my busy schedule, to read a book daily. My preset goals/targets help automatically shuffle the books and I have not come across a recommended book I didn‚Äôt want to read.
It really helps me to grow
Very interested in this app
This app is great I‚Äôve been using it less then a week read about 5 15 mins books from self discipline to having an unlimited memory there‚Äôs so many little things you can incorporate into your life immediately to help change your mindset there‚Äôs a week free trial but I would 100% recommend paying for a whole year this would keep you committed to self change
I downloaded this as I was in a point in life where I needed a boost and direction. What I didn‚Äôt need was the inability to cancel the free subscription and be automatically charged a years subscription with no option for anything else. Very scary, hoping apple can retrieve my 79.99. Honestly don‚Äôt do it.
"It‚Äôs very unclear what this app.does and its content isn‚Äôt explained at all. 

√é was led to download it in a way that was very unclear ad I was promised to get a picture of what type of personality I belong to.

Then I was asked to register for a ¬´ 7 day free trial ¬ª with still no further explanation of what I could really expect from the app, only a very confusing long term and conditions.

Been there done that. Apple‚Äôs policy in terms of reimbursement of such scams is too shallow and risky so the  next thing I do will be to delete this app,"
Really needed this app today. Paying monthly is affordable for most and very worth it if helps your mental well-being.
Great idea and concept but the audio books just don‚Äôt work which was my preference, spent ages trying to get something to play and tried downloading too. Gave up in the end : /
Excellent short summary‚Äôs of inspiring books chosen for me
It gives you the best point of the book and such informative
Amazing app
Es f√°cil de escuchar y con poco tiempo de tu d√≠a, son res√∫menes bastantes inspiradores
I‚Äôve bought plenty of books which sound great but have poorly written content once you get into it. I‚Äôve also bought books which teach me very little that‚Äôs new. This app eliminates both of these and gives you the best selection of books worth reading, for me, even though I don‚Äôt have time to do it daily, it‚Äôs worth its weight in gold!
"When a chapter ends and I press play- It skips a chapter. 

And why oh why can‚Äôt you choose the reading voice? The dude sounds like a robot.

It‚Äôs sooooo stupid! And I feel stupid for paying for it"
They don‚Äôt have books from Aristotle or other great minds most of it is woke, emotional feelings and and propaganda books.. to put it simple all the writers that couldn‚Äôt sell their books because it was rubbish are here honestly I do not recommend this app, I will be cancelling , the only way I will come back is if they stop with this propaganda books and bring out real intelligent book, for f sake there are more books about feelings then developing the mind üö∂üèªüö∂üèªüö∂üèªüö∂üèªüö∂üèªüö∂üèª
Having just started with Headway it may be a bit soon to give a comprehensive review but so far I‚Äôve found it very good. The books I‚Äôve chosen are to get me motivated and disciplined again after a long illness. I‚Äôll keep you posted.
Highly recommended
Good for your mental stimulation and quick and easy reads.
Really cool app‚Ä¶. Part of my daily routine!! Couldn‚Äôt do without
Amazing. This app is priceless
Downloaded the app, was okay. Cancelled the trial. Deleted the app. Next week ¬£80 goes out of my account. I cancelled the trial and I don‚Äôt even have the app installed how can you take my money??
Looks fab but to pricey
Lovely app. Particularly great insights on time management books
Great way to add value to your life and for the people around you; who will also benefit from enhanced relationships with you.
I don‚Äôt read, never have, except at school/college. My young daughter doesn‚Äôt share my ignorance, reads avidly and unconsciously shamed me into searching for an app to help me change my habit. This is the one and it has not only changed my habit but opened up a new world of educating and learning (at 55!!!)
It was my first experience with audiobooks and it is amazing I really enjoyed it and I have listened to two books so far ü§©
I‚Äôve only been using Headway a few days but I‚Äôm really enjoy it. I love to read and also like to keep learning and challenging myself but with a hectic work and family life don‚Äôt get to enjoy books like I used to. This is the answer! I get the key take outs from a new book everyday and am also now regularly taking 15mins out for myself whilst learning something new or seeing a new perspective. Highly recommend.
I find the guy‚Äôs voice annoying. It almost sounds like an automated voice‚Ä¶which is possibly is. I find myself drifting away quite a bit.
I guess many of you have busy life, sometimes we don‚Äôt have so much time to read or listening hours and hours of interesting book, I reckon this app is great for topics on personal development explained in easy style!!!
Perfectly fit in to modern life style l
Tried to unsubscribe 4 times now but still getting several emails a day.  Complaint passed on to ICO.
Great if you don‚Äôt have time to read all the books you‚Äôd like to
"It says there is a 7 day free trial, but if you download or use the app in any way during this period you will be immediately charged the full amount. What a con! I‚Äôve been charged ¬£60 for just opening the app and having a look at what it contains.

Update: I‚Äôm response to their reply, I still don‚Äôt understand why I was charged after less than 24 hours when I had simply downloaded the app and opened it up. Not really a free trial‚Ä¶"
I don‚Äôt have time to listen to every self help book ever written, but I do have time to spend improving myself.
This app helps a lot my learning in English. I recommended.
Good brief to the point overviews of books
This app has given me a lot of gems and nuggets of wisdom that‚Äôve actually applied to my life.
This app is great. My brother recommended it and it‚Äôs speed learning at its finest!
Beware of this app. If you authorise a subscription they will try and trick you into buying expensive ebooks afterwards which then happens without authorisation. I contacted their customer service immediately and they refuse to give me a refund. I don‚Äôt even know where the ebook will be delivered to.
Already got through some great books in less than a week.. so cool!
You‚Äôre better off looking on YouTube summaries or reading the book/Audible. This is just another app that doesn‚Äôt deliver on what it promises and you‚Äôll just hype yourself up for ‚Äúcompleting‚Äù a book. The content of each book is very far off the message that this app conveys.
Lots of variety of books that i am currently loving. I have truly expanded my learning. The book suggestions are tailored to your needs. They are quick reads so can be done in 10-15 mins whenever your having down time!
Instagram ad markets this app to you based on a fun looking intelligence type test, this doesn‚Äôt exist in app at all. So don‚Äôt waste your time, would be good if you like books but it‚Äôs false marketing.
Very inspiring and gives me so much motivation and hope for my future. Easy to navigate through and to understand.
"The recordings sound quite robotic and I imagine the summaries have been generated and slightly touched up. Ends up getting through the basic ideas of books but it‚Äôs a bit of a pain to listen to/read. 

Also it‚Äôs promoting an intelligence type test that you can‚Äôt take anywhere - why? Click bait?"
I enjoy using Headway. It‚Äôs my go to app when I have no energy for podcasts, books or even listening to music. It allows me to extract the most useful and inspiring info from some of the most interesting and life-changing books published. The app is well-built. Some of the summaries are not as well written than others but the feedback feature allows me to point to any sub-standard summaries.
I've been using this app for two days now and I really like it.
This app summarises major books to allow you to digest them easily. Great in theory, but the voices they use to summarise them are terrible and really hard to listen to. They also don‚Äôt remind you when they are going to renew your subscription, so my recommendation is to cancel your subscription as soon as payment is taken when you first sign up (if you still want to risk it that is!). They‚Äôve just refused to refund me which is unacceptable but its ‚Äútheir policy‚Äù. Terrible customer service. Use at your own risk.
This is a wonderful app
Nothing to complain and straight to the point like match of the day but for books simply great find.
I started using headway out of curiosity.  I‚Äôve found it to be a great way to learn, retrain and start to refocus my thoughts and drive.
I ordered this and cancelled immediately so I could get the 7 day free trial but have since charged me ¬£30!
"The one thing I actually liked about this app is that it made me realise how cool it is that I haven‚Äôt spent a penny on these crap books üòÑ

As I mentioned, the books are not worth anyone‚Äôs time, so don‚Äôt waste your money on paid subscription - the content is just‚Ä¶very bad and basic. The question that kept popping up in my head was: why would anyone write a whole book about this at all?!

Also, as someone mentioned in their review - books are read by a computer, not by a human which isn‚Äôt a great deal really bust sometimes it gets hard to understand."
Easy Inspiring Informative
Impossible to cancel. A robot read bits of books in a monotonous tone for 59.99 complete crap. Must be fake reviews. I‚Äôm so angry they have charged me twice.
If I can have portrait mode, I can make notes on the other side of the screen. Please can we have it?nthanks.
I absolutely love the Headway App! I‚Äôve been listening and reading from the app for a few years. I tend to listen to the app whilst going for my morning run, or during my lunch break. Highly recommended.
Loads of content, easy to use, can‚Äôt fault it!
Looking for fiction ? Not here.
Just 15mins a day really kickstarts my day.
Excellent concept. I‚Äôve been looking for an app like this for years. Well worth the money.
Allows me to keep learning and inspired with a busy life. Love it
Doing the 3 day trial, really enjoying the condensed selection I took off a star as I‚Äôm not looking forward to the price tag.
The idea of summarising a book into its succinct lessons, read is only a few minutes is just genius, this app is fantastic.
"Really good App to encourage you for start reading useful books üôè
Review Add up later üëá
It‚Äôs about a month I‚Äôm using it and normally using audio books , I finished 27 books"
I discovered the app by chance and once I started I couldn't stop. Highly recommend this for people who love to read but don't seem to know which book to buy next.
I started using this app as I find It hard looking for what to read but also the time to read. This app made a difference in that and I would highly recommend it!
I don‚Äôt know who had this brilliant idea but üëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæAs someone that really enjoys self-help books, but always jumps straight to the point, this app is just heaven sent! In a few pages you get all the information you need, all substancial, no crap or beating around the bushes, I love it!
Great great great
"I like the concept however, the monotone robotic voiced used is tedious. 
I‚Äôm sure using humans to read may well be more expensive in the long run, but it would deliver a more dynamic read. 
Sorry, deleted as I can‚Äôt take the robotic voice. Other alternative options available are better in my opinion."
Love the App, please add more titles.
Appalling quality levels of content ‚Ä¶ if stating the obvious your idea of growth etc etc then carry on ‚Ä¶ after one weeks trial it‚Äôs 79.99 a year ‚Ä¶ blink and you‚Äôll miss this of course ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the idea ‚Ä¶ waste of time‚Ä¶ waste of money
I like how you can choose your goal, get summary of books and thus get inspired and learn quicker
Thank you I‚Äôm definitely becoming more productive after listening to many of your guides! üôè
BE AWARE you might get billed for your trial..I had never used the app before but after signing up I got billed (¬£12.99) + subscribed straight away‚Ä¶not the way to get new users if this is their strategy..
A growing selection of books and very nicely summarised. I definitely recommend this app
This was one method of getting my life back on track
This app is quite amazing, I don‚Äôt have premium but every day I get access to a free book and they are very relatable to what I wanna work on and learn, I definitely will be getting premium once I am able to , great app definitely recommend
The summaries are interesting and well summarised even in the free section.
"Monotone reading by robotic voices so bad I deleted the app in the end after trying a good few books thinking I‚Äôd persevere past the free trial. I paid for the subscription and cancelled for the following year. 

Support said they have no record of cancellation and have charged me again for the forthcoming year. It‚Äôs ok now though as they cancelled any future payments‚Ä¶.apparently, we shall see. 

Just another subscription based business preying on customers bank accounts and no doubt making a fortune. Must be amazing to just be able to dip into customers banks and help yourself to the best parr of ¬£50 a year and then tell you it‚Äôs their ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù not to refund. AVOID this company! 

Cue the same ‚Äúsorry you were disappointed‚Äù reply by customer service hoping that another sign up will not read the real reviews by real people. There‚Äôs better apps out there just make sure you read the warnings first."
"This is a huge con! The subscription is ¬£79 for the year. 
You cannot cancel this easily. I‚Äôve had to write an email to request that they delete my account & cancel my subscription. 
You can‚Äôt do this yourself. 
I‚Äôve tried to go through my phone settings to cancel the subscription but it does work."
Love the summaries and this app
Great app and inspiring
Only just got into Headway but already loving it. Like the bite size summaries for a busy lifestyle so I can still make time to listen & read.
Thankyou for this great app
"I‚Äôm enjoying Headway because the books are very helpful, informative and there are great topics. Definitely recommended. 
Thank you"
"Tricky product placement with one click subscribe, be careful no refunds, I was happy to try for one month for 6.99, but immediately after this page a near identical page with click buttons in the exact same spot appeared, I didn‚Äôt get a chance to pull my finger off the screen, it would have kept going upwards of ¬£100 in seconds 

I don‚Äôt deal with dishonest companies, what‚Äôs better scamming people like this or giving good customer service to ensure repeat custom 

Deleted and cancelled, see ya üëã"
Great for short and sweet learning - gets to the point and will definitely help you improve your life. The subscription is worth it!
I accidentally clicked on purchase infographics after purchasing the app, and immediately emailed the support team of my mistake. They replied to say nothing can be done, which is extremely disappointing. To be forced into paying an extra ¬£25 after purchasing the app for a simple mistake is unacceptable, and done by just a simple accidental click. Not happy with the service at all.
"Really unique app, it basically jump starts you into any book giving you enough to go on and learn about various topics of interests. 
I 100% recommend!!!"
Very insightful and straight to the point , very helpful
"I‚Äôve only been using this app for a short time but I love it. 
I have such a busy schedule but I love to consume knowledge from self development books. This is a fantastic way to do that whilst also having a busy schedule"
I love it; easy to use!
"I‚Äôve only really just started using Headway as a way to try and improve myself. I love the idea and think it‚Äôs great to simplify a lot of difficult information from different books into one central hub.

One thing that could be improved is the Audiobook voices. I feel like it‚Äôd be great to have multiple different voices to choose from for differing books. I find it quite hard to listen to the books rather than read them because of the computer-like voices.

Overall, really like it and look forward to learning more! Thanks"
"Game changing! For those who have an unrelenting pursuit of excellence and that constant thirst to learn, making those incremental improvements each day.

This is for you, fitting learning in with work and family life it can sometimes be a challenge and a chore, this app is mind blowing in the speed at which you can absorb new lessons / information the key is the bitesize chunks  that allow you to pick up frequently each day! 

Excellent app!"
Some of the books repeat the same content summaries in different chapters using two different narrators. It‚Äôs pretty strange and feels like a lack of quality and attention to detail
This proves technology permits what time does not
"I would give this more stars if one major problem of this app was rectified. That is, on an iPad, if you press the ‚ÄòRepetition‚Äô button, and then ‚ÄòRepeat Cards‚Äô, it takes you to a page where it asks you,‚Ä¶  ‚ÄòDo you remember this?‚Äô On the iPhone there is a choice of ‚Äòyes‚Äô ‚Äòno‚Äô buttons, but on the iPad there are no buttons so you can‚Äôt answer the question. I have the latest iPad Pro, so I don‚Äôt know why the buttons aren‚Äôt there. It just means I have to go to my phone if I want to complete the repetitions. I‚Äôve mailed customer support many times and had no response. 
 They have since emailed me back and said that they have no record of my email address, so I don‚Äôt have an account with them. I subscribed through the App Store, you dingbats. Totally useless.
I‚Äôve now messaged them again and told them I subscribe through the App Store, yet, again, they just keep replying to me saying they have no record of my email address. 
Just address the issue, instead of coming back with moronic responses."
"Fantastic app, quick and to the point - love it!! 

Only feedback is to please change the voice of the narrator so that listening to the book summaries is enjoyable."
Great contents in a concise format
If, like me, you are familiar with subscriptions via the Apple Store then BEWARE before you sign up for this service. You have to pay via Paypal, outside the Apple ecosystem. When you cancel your subscription in the App Store, they keep charging you. If you complain, they send you a multi page terms and conditions document to look at. Headway is an unethical business, and I strongly suggest you avoid completely.
I‚Äôve just read a book that stated that a woman shouldn‚Äôt need to work. That families should be able to live off a man‚Äôs wage and if a woman wants to work then her income is just an added bonus to the family .. Headspace , this is 2022. You need to refresh your books
Very very great app to improve yourself and become the best version of yourself am using it at 17 years old and it‚Äôs really helping mee in all aspects that I need to improve and showing me the aspects which I made mistakes or was wrong on.
Makes learning enjoyable, quick and easy. Have really benefited from the format of the books on offer and have improved my mindset, goals and mental health as a result.
"A well put together app. If you like gamifying things there‚Äôs collections of books to master new areas of growth. You can search their entire collection for a specific book. Anytime you you highlight a phrase it‚Äôs stored in a convenient area to revisit as well as a neat repetition feature to help the long term memory capture it. 

I‚Äôve always been one to claim I don‚Äôt have time to read but this app has helped me prove myself wrong as sometimes I‚Äôll read two summaries a day! Certainly helped carve some of my social media time for more productivity!"
Easy to read and gets straight to the point with the information without the need to over-word it and confuse you.
Excellent
"This kind of activity is going to destroy faith in Apple/Google. Nothing about this app is true. No intelligence test; no free trial and none of the positive reviews can be real. They will take your funds and then not return them as soon as you agree to the free trial. 
The fact Apple and Google don‚Äôt remove this app‚Äôs ability to operate is very concerning"
Awesome
Good app
I‚Äôve just signed up to Headway, and I‚Äôm enjoying the new insight gathered so far
"This app doesn‚Äôt offer any free trials, so you‚Äôre forced into a paid subscription (with no refund potential) without even having the opportunity to try the app first. 
Also the narrator‚Äôs voice is so boring and monotonous it‚Äôs hard to pay attention.
Overall, I‚Äôm really disappointed with this app and their customer service."
Helps me retrain my brain
"I signed up for free trial then ¬£6.99 a month 
Headways took additional ¬£19.99 as well & are saying it‚Äôs in terms and conditions !
I signed up for ¬£6.99 not ¬£26.99 
Misleading info"
10 times better than Grammarly. Keep doing what you are doing and you just gained a subscriber for life
A great app I wish I would of discovered a long time ago! So easy and quick and the info is very useful inspirationalüòä
Use this as background noise as I‚Äôm doing my work
I‚Äôm using the free trial just to see how the app works and if it‚Äôs actually worth the ¬£¬£¬£. Tbh the app actually has a real good range of books to read from that match what you pick for your personality traits at the start up of the app. If the app was just a bit cheaper I would buy it:)
Because those are short summaries you feel like you‚Äôve just read a book in 10 minutes. They‚Äôre very well written and easy to comprehend. 100% recommended.
Love it
"Knowledge is power and the self love we owe ourselves, in order to achieve contentment. 
I feel a sense of enrichment whilst listening to topics of interest that I find motivational. 
Love the fact I listening to topics available as and when I can #cptsd+mumlife.
Amazing work - bless you all!"
It‚Äôs a pretty good, very informative app and actually helps me quite a lot already. I just think it‚Äôs a bit too expensive
Love this! I have undiagnosed adhd and this makes learning so much easier x
"Having tried Blinkist and being impressed, before I went for a years subscription I thought I would try this app as it seemed to be competition.

How wrong I was; 

The book list is very small compared to Blinkist.

However most crucial is the absolutely appalling voice used on the listen features to the books. It‚Äôs both grating and distracting at the same time.

So hard pass for me."
"This is actually jogging my memory back to mindfulness- listening- learning- ripple effects- Good Boss - Great workforce- Great workforce Steadfast Company. 
Healthy eating and drinking as con-try to belief  the mind doesn‚Äôt determine your mood ; day;  life etc your Stomach does it controls everything, so fuel it . (Don‚Äôt believe me look it up ) 
I work better on an empty stomach with a cup of coffee - Creator didn‚Äôt make us eat breakfast first . Mine is McDonald‚Äôs about 11 o‚Äôclock after I‚Äôve done 6 hours in the office."
"Fantastic!!!
Short reads, straight to the point and enjoyable"
fantastic app that keeps you on track and focused whilst teaching your things!!!
Very nice app. Even in the free version, it‚Äôs only 1 book a day but for free I think it‚Äôs worthy. Good enough to consider paying a subscription
Hard to delete account after the trial ended. Took many emails and still getting no response. The app won‚Äôt let you delete
I love reading all books the way explaining apically for the first time reader
Excellent books summary and Titles
For someone who‚Äôs intimidated by thickness of books and work as a full time employee, Headway is definitely a very useful app to ‚Äòspeed read‚Äô books. I think Headway summarises the book in each chapter, the only question I have is how well they cover all content from the book. However, I would say Headway has pretty much included all important information from the chapters, I read some of the summary from books I‚Äôve read before.   Overall, I really enjoy Headway and I hope they have more books coming.
Very interesting information, existing
"I like this app but please don‚Äôt think you will learn a lot from what you hear in 20 mins. You are given a high level account of the books but not enough to learn skills if you listen to self education material.
It does allow you to learn a little and then you can buy the actual book if you want. 

Some of the books I read require the full book and it can‚Äôt be taught in 20 mins so a lot of the books and subjects aren‚Äôt really right for this app."
Very informative. Little changes make better life
Was inspiring straight to the point will be reading more
I like reading but massive volumes nowadays is impossible for anyone to read in-time information. This app is great at delivering vast amount of information in a quick way. If you happen to read something so intriguing and wanna extend, you can always get the book somewhere.
These bite size books are great for a few headlines from each book but if like me you enjoy the depth and richness of a book, these are ultimately not very satisfying. On the other hand if reading is not your thing - these summaries are good for an overview.
"Love coming on Headway, it‚Äôs approach to help the information be clearly understood is great. 
Love the daily insights ‚ù§Ô∏è moody-nicks"
"Well this is massively disappointing. Completely boring, repetitive platitudes and jargon, badly written and with poor grammar. After reading the ‚Äòsummaries‚Äô you are invited to buy the whole book from Amazon, which seems like a complete ripoff.  This is not how Headway presents itself in their advertising at all and has very little to do with one‚Äôs intelligence or learning preferences.
Also, the information is completely American concentric, providing useless financial information for those in other countries."
In-app offered free 7-day trial but charged the full amount when signing up for it. Very misleading.
Clicked through on an advert to take a test and it‚Äôs not available ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è deleted
"They make you pay to join and then try to charge you extra to get your results.
‚ÄúFree 7 days trial‚Äù means nothing"
Really disappointed. Put in my interests and details but couldn‚Äôt read any of the books without being prompted to try the trial and pay up. I was all up for using this app but without any opportunity to even try it out, I‚Äôve deleted it and will look for something more accessible.
When I saw the price of the subscription I thought it was way overpriced.  Then I was offered a 50% discount as I never signed up, followed by a further 70% discount.  By which time I‚Äôm wondering why they just didn‚Äôt price it up reasonably in the first place rather than trick people into paying what they don‚Äôt need to.  It‚Äôs all a bit underhand and not the kind of organisation I want to do business with.   It‚Äôs a great idea, but why not just offer it at a reasonable price to begin with?  I won‚Äôt be buying.
I‚Äôm at a turning point and need some inspiration/guidance and Headway is helping! The books are bite-sized, so manageable if you‚Äôre busy. So far they‚Äôre varied and rich in content. Fabulous app. Thank you! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
Sneaky pushy ads to get you to subscribe. Just accidentally paid ¬£58, a few mins earlier it was showing that it was ¬£27. I‚Äôm not going to try and get a refund as I can imagine where they‚Äôll tell me to stick it.
Very positive and very helpful!
"This app is an absolute scam, I paid ¬£15 for the three month membership and then clicked through a link that wasn‚Äôt clear, only to be charged another ¬£15! I complained and got my
second ¬£15 back to now find that they have stopped my access to the books so I have essentially paid ¬£15 for nothing! I have cancelled my trial. Please read the bad reviews for this app as I have found out other people are having the same issue."
Great way to digest spoons of knowledge in shorter pace of time
It‚Äôs great app. Very helpful.
I‚Äôm 2 books in and I have already thought about and learned multiple key aspects that I can improve and think on!
Great app; tailored to you & full of inspiration!
Total rip off‚Ä¶.
Recommended for anyone who enjoys an app that constantly tries to push its in app purchases, REALLY loves to soak up all that sweet sweet personal data, and just generally loves to get in the way of any function it is ostensibly supposed to be fulfilling. Oh let‚Äôs not forget the egregiously false advertising that will lead you to download it. No idea why this junk is allowed on the App Store. Just ugh.
This app lets you absorb some of the essence of a book effortlessly.
Great to be able to ‚Äòread‚Äô some of those books that have been on my shelves for ages! It‚Äôs so fab to have access to golden nuggets of self-help whenever I need it üëåüèª
Love it!!
"Ad lures me to find out my intelligence type. Quiz was hard to locate. Asking me to take a test and then tricking me to purchase with a ‚Äògift of 70%‚Äô off before I find out the results is not really customer friendly. 
¬£80 not worth it for summaries that come with no context. 1 week of trial wouldn‚Äôt be long enough to know anything. Much rather scout for a book in a bookstore, Amazon or goodreads and find summaries for free. Please add more value to the app or lower the price and stop pushing to start trial or sign up for subscription at every point. 
Deleting for 2nd time."
"I don‚Äôt leave many reviews but I don‚Äôt like my time being wasted!

This is a short version.
I downloaded the app to do the ‚Äúintelligence test‚Äù answered all the questions then hit a pay wall. You cannot get any results until you pay üôÑ. 

Hopefully they change it soon ü§ûüèº

Good luck"
Many good and big influence people around the globe have their books inside the application
"I stumbled across this app by chance, and I‚Äôm really pleased I followed it through.  
Bite sized nuggets of incredibly useful information to help you, help yourself and others, and basically, make your life a whole lot easier, productive, fulfilled and clear."
"instant ick and uninstall
No thx"
Only on my third day of using the headway app and already have picked up a lot of really useful tips on how to organise my life and identify and overcome negative thoughts.  I don‚Äôt have a lot of time to read books so taking the best bits from a number of books has been invaluable to me. I‚Äôm already feeling more positive.
They don‚Äôt do refunds. They automatically renew your subscription. They dupe you into making additional purchases, but if you press the wrong button or change your mind tough luck. If this was a physical shop I would defecate on the floor, then stand at the front telling everyone not to bother.  The only lesson this app taught me is don‚Äôt buy from shysters like these.
I have read four books on the app and I‚Äôve learnt a lot.
Only after downloading and giving them all your personal info do they tell you the price.
"I enjoy the app and go through the summaries daily so for that it‚Äôs great, but the idea that it is going to tell you how to use your ‚Äòintelligence type‚Äô is vastly overplayed from a single test. 
Also the a lot of the books are woke af."
Good collection but for audio ‚Äî I don‚Äôt like robotic sound. It will be nice to have some actual human sound options to choose from which would make listening to the books more realistic.
"For someone with ADHD, I always have a million things I would like to improve about my self and want to find efficiencies in everything I do. However, as a mum of 2, working full time and in a high level position, finding the time to do this is a struggle. And then when I do, the beauty‚Äôs of my condition kick in and finding the patience and motivation to sit and read a book on ‚Äòhow to get better at reading books‚Äô just doesn‚Äôt happen!

Headway has created a platform where it is quick and simple for me to learn and process new information on how to achieve my goals and improve aspects of my life, it has been an absolute game changer for me!"
I‚Äôm a butterfly reader so great for me
Books are well summarised and easy to take the main point of of them
You have to pay for everything so it‚Äôs a waste of time.
"A poor effort on all sides 
Chapters missing
The ‚Äúreader‚Äù has hiccups at times.
Very poorly constructed app.
There‚Äôs other apps doing the same thing for cheaper."
Great app, great selection of books and very helpful daily inspirations
Lo recomiendo mucho la verdad muchos libros tienen el secreto de dirigir tu vida o como ves al mundo que te rodea.
The app gives you a free insight to a book everyday -usually enough to get the gist of the book! I set my preferences to self-help books and the tree daily book has been great so far. Would absolutely recommend if you are trying to get into reading.
I have just unblock my brain to learn and read through what really matters to succeed in life
When you get a significant leadership role, the first piece of advice relates to the numerous books you need to have already read or need to read immediately- as if the role or the time you spent climbing the ladder could afford you the time to read any of the books cover to cover in a month! This App circumvents that impossibility and has the best collection of books from which to choose. Wish I‚Äôd known about Headway sooner.
"There are so many books I want to read but never find the time. Downloaded this as it looked like the perfect solution, but having read quite a few of the summaries I‚Äôve found them all very disappointing, in most cases struggling to get a good understanding of the books main points.
The summaries for each book seem very poorly written, sentences are frequently missing words, and often rely on context that has not been included.
If you try this app, make sure you sign up for the free trial first. Very glad I didn‚Äôt subscribe to the near ¬£60 fee!"
fast, effective and completely useful - much better than reading endless different books, podcasts etc going in all different directions
This is a good app for me as I like to read but am always short of time so the potted versions of the books I want to read served up by this app are useful to me
While the messages from books are great. I find the speed at which the messages are conveyed are too hasty.  It sounds rushed and makes me anxious. When turning the speed down on my phone to 0.75 it is too slow. Not sure how to find an ideal between 0.75 and 1. Am sure if can find the right speed will enjoy listening to messages more.
Gives great summaries of books in nice manageable chunks for reading or listening to
Worth the read and listen; it Depends on what you prefer of course.
Found this read so useful will definitely god willing put this into practice
"I‚Äôve paid for this but for some reason the app is no longer working, I‚Äôve reinstalled it, with no luck at all, customer service contacted me, but they gave up and I didn‚Äôt hear anyth since, loosing ¬£29 
NOT RECOMMEND"
Fantastic app, however a little expensive. Defo worth the money but not affordable for everyone.
"I have a paid subscription and I find it very lacking. The adds are misleading - they lead me to believe I would have many visual graphics, when actually that is something you pay separately for (you get 5(!!!) books explained visually, no more.

The book selection isn‚Äôt great, but I find the summaries useful to choose which book to read.

The app is a great idea, I just wish there were no misleading adds and that the selection was better. As it is, I feel like I wasted my money."
"I‚Äôve been using headway for a week now and have been finding it very useful.

It is perfect for those like me who struggle reading for long amounts of time, but seek the guidance and lessons self help books contain"
"I signed up for the trial all of the sudden got fully charged 
Also there is very limited access to summaries 
Pure SCAM"
Really enjoying the books they are bitesized and really informative. They have some hidden costs here and there which is annoying but overall good
Key content summarised in a nice and easy way to absorb. Thank you
Head way books are top notch and inspirational as they are easy to read and learn things.
It‚Äôs easy to understand because you‚Äôre just given the salient points
I would recommend this app to anyone, no excuse not to read up on anything as it is so easy to navigate and the point it pulls from books are explained to a high degree. Very impressed.
I love this app because I love reading but I don‚Äôt always have the time to read a whole book but this app summarises and makes it easy for me to still continue reading.
I have gone in to read the whole book in some cases.. others I was happy with just the summary! Still new to the app but first impressions are good
"You spent your valuable time to do the rest, then you are asked to pay or else you get nothing. A waste of time 
Error message pops up each time you open the app"
Enjoy this App and it really help‚Äôs me and has been very beneficial to my mindset and really changed my way of thinking leading me to get more from life!
Firstly, this asks a lot of questions, but doesn‚Äôt pre-warn you that you have to pay in order to get the analysis thereafter. Bit of a con really‚Ä¶
Educative books.
I downloaded the app to see what was on it and it kept popping up with free trial and i didnt want that and i couldnt even read the books or anything
Good app but not another bloody subscription based app. Subscription to this and that nowadays. You can‚Äôt just buy stuff anymore, I hope you take all your subs, shine them up real good, turn them sideways and shove them where the sun don‚Äôt shine.
Pretty disappointed that this app has only voice reading every story, and it sounds like AI is reading it, not a human being. I bought this as an alternative to podcasts if I just needed something quick to listen to but I just can‚Äôt listen to the monotonous, void-of-emotion voice that reads the books. Waste of money.
This app has a lot of benefits to help you live your everyday life. It shows the depth in the little things we do and how important they are. Would highly recommend.
Brilliant idea and well executed. It‚Äôs accessible and informative thank you mirelle
They make you do the test but to see the result you need to pay. So cheap üëé
Very easy to use and expand your mind daily with bite size chunks of info. Everyone can find 10-20 mins a day to listen and learn!
"I have to say, what an amazing choice of books to listen to. I prefer the audio as I have a visual impairment in my right eye.. also, it allows me to listen on the go and take in more information. 

My biggest criticism would the the narration. Some of the voices are really hard to listen to, and others sound very robotic.  If they‚Äôre using people to narrate, the sound is so over processed. One voice exaggerates every single word, and I can‚Äôt listen to it. I do wish there were other accents rather than just American. It would be good if there were some choices with voices too. 

I would give the app a 5 had it not been for the narration, as it really is a great app with lots of amazing books"
i cant express my gratitude towards this incredible app. Best platform to get your daily dose of knowledge. Summaries of books of multiple genres is the most exciting thing about it.
Very happy with it. Great summaries and insights into some useful ideas and techniques. Also a nice variety, there‚Äôs something for everyone.
"I was charged ¬£59.99 to read extracts of books? I had technical issues trying to cancel my free trial and then I was charged for a years membership which I will not be using as I find this app to be an overpriced waste of time. I tried contacting Apple but I was greeted with a very sterile, ‚Äòcomputer says no‚Äô type response when trying to appeal my case.
Do not be fooled by all of the ads related to intelligence types, specialised learning and the promise of self development. Get a library card and  just read a book; you will save yourself from ¬£60 of disappointment."
This app has so many self help books to choose from and they literally take 10/15 minutes to read and you get the same motivation as if you‚Äôve read the actual book! 10/10 recommend
Common sense advice that we all need prompting on
Pretty accurate and fulfilling summaries of lots of great books and literature. A lot to be learned and a great way to find out if you want to purchase the full book that peaks your interest.
Love the idea of this but was charged straight away when it was meant to be 7 days free trial.  I have had to ask iTunes for a refund and hope they agree.
I deleted the app and it still charges me. Not happy
One of those apps that flaunts a cheap subscription of about $12 that magically turns into 50 a month for a bunch of short books. Criminal
As a dad of two newborns and working full time it is nearly impossible to be able to relax and read a full book. This app made it possible for me! Truly amazing work! I am so glad I found it.
Forming new habits like Headway is never easy, but it‚Äôs been a fantastic experience so far. Cut the fat and get to the point.
As a UK resident I found the voices of the first 5 or so books I tried to be so distracting! The computer narration is awful (like sat-nav American) just can‚Äôt hear past the voices to listen to what they‚Äôre saying. I signed up to a 6 month deal for ¬£23.99 this morning and have emailed support to cancel and refund as doubtful I‚Äôll ever listen to any of them.
This app isn‚Äôt bad, I liked its layout and contents but sometimes I wanted to listen rather than read but couldn‚Äôt because the voices you‚Äôve used to read the text were the most obnoxious I‚Äôve ever heard. Scratchy, robotic, bad pronunciation. Please work a bit harder on finding people that aren‚Äôt nails down a blackboard üò¨
I‚Äôm using the free journals so far, and I think they are a great read. We need to self develop and I feel like this app is great. Might opt in for the premium version!
This is great in such a busy life. Appreciate the apps effort and functionality. Thank you
I enjoyed reading this book. It was straight to the point and the information was real and practical. Very easy read and understand. Would definitely recommend this book
Very disappointing. Found the content low grade and really not very useful. Many of the items suggested repeated the same content. Sadly wanted this to be useful but it just wasn‚Äôt . Steer clear and save your money - I wish I had! Ended up ¬£23.99 out of pocket. Beware the rapid fire click bait that I foolish fell for.
"This seems like a very promising app. However I have had it for three days, having good internet connection and iphone 11, and most of the time i cannot reproduce the audio chapters. Can only see the text. Have contacted support straight away in day 1 and they weren‚Äôt very helpful haven‚Äôt heard from them again yet. I honestly think is a bit too expensive for this sort of issues.
Ps: note the reading voice option is a robot reading which i find a bit annoying too."
After reading over 330 audible books I decided to make a change and download Headway after it was recommended to me by a very successful friend. A lot of the time the message the authors are sending become very clear, very quickly as you read through the book. Picking out the main messages from different books has so far saved me hours of time. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôll never read a book again üòÖ and so far I‚Äôm very happy with the Headway app. 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è
"Similar to other reviews on her, I subscribed which was a huge mistake. The ‚Äòbooks‚Äô are not books, they are brief summaries of existing books and the bulk of the point to the books is missed. You‚Äôd be better buying the actual book itself for the price of the app.
Also, I paid ¬£58 for an annual subscription and an offer popped up on the app offering it for ¬£48 instead and stated I would be refunded the difference between what I‚Äôd already paid. The refund never came so currently I‚Äôve been charged almost ¬£100 for an app that isn‚Äôt even worth ¬£1. The customer service is terrible, I just receive a copy and pasted email back every time I‚Äôve tried to contact and no one is willing to help. Do not buy this app."
"This app is not legit. 
doesn‚Äôt work properly 
The voices are computer generated and really annoying b
Books are very limited 
Don‚Äôt give refunds after they took extra subscriptions from me!!! Terrible customer service. 
BEWARE SCAM"
"I get that one of your sources of income are this app, but it needs to be organised differently. 

Instead of charging for a personality test (which should be free) and charging a membership, you should make it so that each individual author can set a price for their books in the app and a preview of the book should be available, like it is on other book apps. 

Please change this."
Sounds like a great idea but it is poorly executed. Summaries are literally just stripped down sentences with very little meaning generated. Waste of money.
Just spent ¬£17+ and can‚Äôt access anything
"I love reading and audio too but like many am time poor. Partly my bad but the app gives you great summaries of the books and a taste to learn more.

Highly recommended"
"Whilst I have enjoyed some of the summaries on this app, it would seem that it is aimed a men only. Some of the material is shockingly mysogynistic (The 4 Hour Body) and whilst working through the 21 day Wellness challenge I was invited to read about how to build the ultimate male body, which, if I skip, I will fail the challenge! As a woman, I have no interest in this. It is irrelevant to me.
 It should be made clear that the app is just for men. I am very disappointed having paid for a years subscription up front."
I signed up for the free trial and I can‚Äôt use it without it taking me to sign up for the free trial! I have tried to listen to books but it keeps saying sign up and when I say sign up it says I‚Äôm already signed up but can‚Äôt listen to anything. Also I see what the app tracks you for and it‚Äôs your purchases, search history and basically everything you do on your phone. Then they can send your data to a marketing company and make squillions.
Pathway for greatness
"Get the core points without the fluff 
This is no substitute for the real learning but provides a useful jumping off point for you to go further. With that in mind, I love this app"
Be careful one week free subscription is offered with the offer of going into a weekly subscription but instead a one year subscription is pilfered out of your Apple account be warned don‚Äôt be tempted to do the one week free subscription
I did the trial week and then when it charged me $130 for the year I looked in the subscription edit section and there was one year available there for $39
Major flaw and weakness is no CarPlay support.
This app is super great for a new start in life I highly recommend this to everyone that‚Äôs trying to get better mental health and better mind set
Great app, almost replaced my social media while I‚Äôm on lunch break at work with this app
Yeh dude
It‚Äôs pre epic
This has changed the way I read book and make reading a new mini habit everyday for me. Thank you
"This app has the most ridiculous pricing structure ever - you can get a year premium for $40 or $200‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs a great idea for an app but I found the book summaries to be monotone and dull. More importantly, for some of the books I had previously read in full, the summary missed the main themes/learnings set out in the original book. 

Also - I didn‚Äôt look in to it but doubt the authors are getting any kickbacks."
"My squirrel brain means reading a whole book is an overwhelming task. These book summaries seem succinct but comprehensive, and give enough room for further independent exploration if desired. The app interface is great, it has some amazing functionality (easily switch between text and audiobook), and seems to have a great range of books available. 
Very glad I purchased. (P.S you can get 70% off if you‚Äôre patient, I paid aud$50)."
I was charged the full $140 (a year‚Äôs subscription) when I clicked free 7 day trial immediately!! When checking my subscriptions it showed that I had signed up to a plan that is called 7 day free trial that costs $140 and ends a year from today. Absolute bs, don‚Äôt be fooled.
Highly recommended App.
I only had this for the week free trial. The content of this app is great however the American accents are too harsh and I just cannot listen to the content. If there was an option to listen with soft English accents I would definitely keep the app past the free trial period.
this would be a better option for you, If your are interested to start a reading experience
Absolutely furious‚Ä¶got offered a 7 day trial, went to cancel straight away so I didn‚Äôt get charged for a year. Next minute, $140 removed from my account! FRAUDS
The amount of money you‚Äôd need to spend to get all this content outside of this app, would be astronomical compared to just buying it here. You have to literally invest in yourself if your going to improve. Also, they literally read it to you. Don‚Äôt be cheap with yourselves.
Every morning I can‚Äôt go without learning/reaffirming all the knowledge that is compressed and compiled in a simple and user friendly way to kickstart a better and more successful day!
"The app itself I‚Äôm yet to try, concept is great. Just be wary, it says free trial but it‚Äôs only a free trial if you click ‚Äúpay yearly‚Äù if you hit ‚Äúpay monthly‚Äù you‚Äôll be charged $20Aud and not get a free trial at all.  
Cheeky and not in good faith. Cancelled my subscription straight away as it should be clearer than that."
So much easier than buying a ton of books‚Ä¶ gets straight to the point!
"Headway is such a great application. It saves time providing summaries of books, and it will bring up precious books that you never heard of; you can listen, read, highlight stuff you think is valuable and share with family, friends and others.

It‚Äôs an application that will make you a better person overall."
Effective way to read books!
Very much enjoy these short sharp chapter summaries of a morning before my day begins. Just puts me in the right frame of mind to take on the daily challenges.
I am in love with this app. Having not enough time to read entirely a hardcover book this app gives us the opportunity to read and listen as much as we can in short periods!
Great app, highly recommended it!!!
I can‚Äôt for the life of me sit and read. Maybe it‚Äôs a bad habit I have produced but I want to learn. So having audio summaries help me as I‚Äôm on the go 24/7! I love this app. I can listen to the summaries again and again till it‚Äôs drilled into my memory banküíï
This app is very helpful I would recommend this to any individual, who‚Äôs coming full circle to doing the right thing for themselves and to have constant and consistent reading material that many great people we know past and present have become successful on their lives and in business success, if you have slight issues or don‚Äôt like writing or journaling this app is the way to go 10/10
Such an amazing app for clarity
"Before I sleep at night I take 15 minutes to make my life better . Highly recommended. 
WORKS!"
I wish i subscribed earlier.
Great app.
Great app
I‚Äôve been floating and stagnant for some time in a number of areas of my life. These bite size summaries are quick and easy to consume and I‚Äôve found them super motivating to improve myself
This app fraudulently offers a free trial and then you can‚Äôt get rid of it.  I found it had signed me up for a subscription automatically costing over $100. And it was extremely difficult to remove.  At this argue I have no idea if it will charge me hundred more in Dec despite me doing everything I can think of to remove the app.  Have reported it.
"Apart from the App not being off any value with the way it works and a waste of time be very careful with your subscription as they mislead you into believing it‚Äôs cancelled until months later you find out they are still taking money out of your credit card.
Complete rip-off!!"
An easy app that really helps learn in short bursts that are sustainable
"Great idea to have a free well trial. 
Really like this idea of reading summaries of books, condensed information but it gets straight to the point, it‚Äôs easy to read and understand, not into one book you can quickly move on to the next (don‚Äôt have to read until the end), loads of books to choose from, love that you have the option to scan through titles and briefs then add to your library to read later and lots of relatable topics to choose from as well."
Thank you
In a short period of time I‚Äôve already been able to learn so much valuable information. I also use this app as my go to little piece of sanctuary for moments when I‚Äôm feeling triggered or stressed. So far it‚Äôs been of great help. Highly recommend.
Useful but a bit too US-centric
"I read anywhere and anytime 
Good app to have"
This has weird religious content creeping in to the courses - they don‚Äôt ask if you want to hear it it just comes in. Also very annoying voice overs. There are better apps.
5 stars
Why not state that a paid subscription is required first, before making the user go through an in-depth survey, rather than prompting them to pay after they have answered all their questions.
I thought I cancelled with in 7 days but must not have so then was charged for product and then another $40ish dollars 6 months later. I wrote as soon as a saw the second transaction and said as they can see I have not used outside the 7 days. I was ok to pay the first but not the second. So be very careful
The choice of titles is great. The summarisations are good. But the voicing of the audio versions is robotic, making it hard to detect the emphasis of a passage, or even distinguish separate points, at times.
Awesome!
i‚Äôve been suffering from clinical depression for the longest time and decided i couldn‚Äôt live this way anymore. i was failing school. failing life. and most of all failing myself and the future i could‚Äôve deprived myself of. i‚Äôm trying to work through and heal so i can become a better person for not only the people around me but myself. i‚Äôve really enjoyed looking through and seeing the changes in my life that can be possible and start putting them into practice within my life. and for the first time in a long time i have the confidence and motivation to not put my future self at a level that i would have to fight at. i‚Äôve been fighting my whole life and i like having the hope that i can change my mindset and have the idea that little things can make the fight less hard. the things they‚Äôve suggested in a few of my books im just keen to put into practice and see myself in a happier swell being space.
"I was sceptical but needed desperately to make some changes my life but was already feeling overwhelmed. 5 minutes a day felt like something I could do‚Ä¶ and I haven‚Äôt every day but as soon as I tried and made an effort to stick to that 5 minutes other areas of my life started improving. 

What a fabulous way to learn without being bogged down in full books, especially if you find it‚Äôs not for you!"
Nice little chunk size reads for the morning routine.
"I have ADHD and English is my second language so I always found it difficult to concentrate on books and understand them from start to finish.
I have started listening to the summarised books while I do other things like at work or while I do yoga or stretching. 
I feel accomplished in a short amount of time and it‚Äôs very informative!! 
Thank you for this app. It‚Äôs perfect for me ! Definitely a good investment of my money because I‚Äôll probably spend that money on food anyway. 
You can also slow down or make it faster!
I will be using this app everyday."
Good selection
So much to learn and it‚Äôs great for people who struggle to read
Great book suggestions, top summaries and I like the ‚Äúremember ‚Äú section at the end to underline the key points of the books.
Do not download this app. I downloaded to use for what I thought was a free trial. I assumed it would give notification before taking a subscription. Instead it has taken 139 dollars for a yearly subscription. üò´
‚Ä¶
"Literally this is the best app I have ever purchased! I don‚Äôt know how much it cost but it‚Äôs so useful and has so much value within that it pays for itself within a couple of days of owning it.
Self development should be a consistent thing that everyone does and teach there children to do- and this app makes it extremely easy and condensed. 
I am reading more than ten books a month !"
I finished the trial week and was charged for a full year subscription at $139. Completely unacceptable tactics and I want my money back.
Using a iPad Pro with apple keyboard, portrait mode doesn‚Äôt really work. Please enable this simple feature!
If you want a quick snippet of lots of sources of information about self-development, this is pretty good.
Daily reminders
Easy to use for those who can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt choose to read
Don‚Äôt bother. This app offers a free trial, but will charge you immediately, therefore voiding the free trial. It‚Äôs literally a lie, it‚Äôs cheeky and rude, and makes zero sense.
"Loving the app so easy to use and very interesting topics and contents. Makes me spend more time listening to books rather wasting time on social media. 

Lovin it already ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Hoping doe a cheaper subscription
I‚Äôve only just started using this app but find it amazing. Also helps to have notifications on as it can give that kick you need to get some education/reading in to your everyday life
Under the guise of their ‚Äúmost cost effective option‚Äù they charge you for a year once your week‚Äôs free trial is over. Proceed with caution. Scamming expletives.
DO NOT purchase this app! If you want a 7 day free trail first you have to select the 12 month option if you select the 3 month option then they charge you. They have made sure not to make that clear. The content is horrible aswell don‚Äôt waste your money.
Took me a year of seeing ads for the app to give it a try. I‚Äôve enjoyed starting my day at 5am with a bike ride followed by a coffee and a quick read of a book summary. It‚Äôs become a ritual for me. I don‚Äôt have the attention span to read multiple full books, so this works well for me.
It‚Äôs great
Inspiring, and motivating!  Some books are challenging and a must to listen to every book to the end,regardless of your own thinking.
I have hit a wall with life and business. This has been completely life changing!
Great help ti grow in minimal time.
Point of book summaries is to LISTEN and LEARN and CONTEMPLATE. How is that possible with a monotone voice, without tone, emotion, inflections, pauses, emphasis? Headway, robot voice alone shows your company values are not 100% authentic. If they were, you‚Äôd be thinking about customer experience, instead of just pushing out Quantity to give appearance of a Blinkist competitor. Won‚Äôt be renewing.
"I‚Äôm really enjoying the titles and short passages you have selected for me to read. They are very motivating and inspirational. 
Thank you"
I cannot recommend this app enough! There is a huge diversity of information that is very easily accessed through either reading or listening the book summaries. I feel like just using this app has helped me grow as an individual! I normally do not purchase premiums in apps, especially ones such as this with such great free access but I have for this app and I cannot recommend it enough! This app is amazing and I am so happy with how it has impacted my life and helped to give me perspective on a variety of areas. Cannot recommend it enough!!!!
Love this. It fills my brain with interesting subjects on my commute to work
"Fantastic service, however seems to me missing key components in making it a truly great offering. 
There is no CarPlay or Apple Watch app. Most people listen to audiobooks on the go, and fiddling with the iPhone app is not ideal. 
However, the iOS App itself is excellent quality, and hope to see the platform expanded with same attention to detail, thank you!"
great app
It would be easier to leave a cartel than cancel a headway subscription, they keep charging you after you cancel and change the name of the transaction so you can‚Äôt determine who is charging you, any obvious tactic. Avoid or you will be paying for years
It is a great app for the beginner‚Äôs who want to start reading books. Some times we feel reading a whole book is hard and we may postpone or skip reading. But in this app we are getting a good summary of the book and it is straight to the point. Once we become habitual reading summaries then slowly we can start reading books. Moreover there is a feature of Free daily read, which we get one random book summary everyday to read for free. We can also listen to the audio instead of reading.
*****
"La el contenido de esta aplicaci√≥n es muy buena. Me encanta! 
Lo q no me ha funcionado es que desde que pague la anualidad no he podido escuchar los audios off line. 
No he recibido soluci√≥n y ya ha pasado m√°s de un mes. Y pr√°cticamente no le he podido sacar el provecho esperado. 
Es muy molesto las publicaciones que se enciende en todo momento en la aplicaci√≥n y seg√∫n d√≥nde indican q se pueden desactivar no aparece la opci√≥n."
I love how you get the key info out of these books in a summarised straight to the point manner. Great selection of titles.
Loving headway.
This is a very useful app for those wanting to practicing the art of reading. I believe in building a better world future through the art of reading. I believe this app needs more support and to encourage self development. I think the app can improve with more features and needs more assortment of different books.
"If you‚Äôre in here to see if it costs you anything, then yes it does. You can participate in a Free Trial like all the other apps. For me, I downloaded this app off an add I saw on my phone showing a certain type of test that the app lets u do. Sadly the first thing I saw was that it‚Äôs an app to read things on and to better your meant health and well-being. Which in itself is great but it‚Äôs not the purpose I downloaded it for and was rather disappointed tbh :( 
If your looking to use the app for its main purpose of reading for wellness then I‚Äôd say this is a great app. In the time that I had used it was very VERY good at sending reminders to my phone to notifying me to read something and it even offered 4 different discounts for the subscription, which is great but not what I needed. To try the app I had to make an account, which I did but once I decided I didn‚Äôt need the app I wanted to delete my account before I delete the app from my phone, but when I tried to delete my account it shut down the app 5 times!! It was annoying me so I left it and tried to do it again another day thinking it‚Äôs just a glitch for it only to not let me delete the account again which really annoyed me so I left it for like a good amount of time and it finally let me delete the account. (I wrote this review once before but it deleted my entire review so here it is for a second timeüëçüèª)"
"Don‚Äôt use this go to other audio books.
It‚Äôs a scam and takes $140 if you press anything. How is this allowed in the App Store?"
Interesting
"There is such a great range of books there so concisely written and easy to read and informative I think as well worth of money especially if you get a discount like I did I think I paid just $50 for this subscription for a year which is really nothing when you were getting this much knowledge.
100% would recommend that the price I paid."
Quite a useful app
App was working fine, paid for my month and cancelled my subscription, wake up to $144 being taken out of my account when I dont use the app anymore and cancelled the subscription.
I have attention issues and this really helps me to learn new things in a short amount of time.
Wish they make a horizontal mode for iPad. Other than that the app is 10/10 :)
I‚Äôm very busy throughout the days and i read slow. This app helps me get through the awesome books that i would have never had the opportunity to finish otherwise! Thanks so much for the summaries!
"I‚Äôve been searching for an easy way to consume high quality content. 
I tried Headway and Blinkist. Eventually, I decided to choose Headway. 

Reasons:
The summaries are succinct yet interesting. It‚Äôs more digestible and entertaining for me. I like they gather quotes as blocks and we can easily export and share. I also like the voice more than the other. 

Somehow Blinkist makes me feel bored and fidget easily ‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs just my personal preference‚Ä¶"
I can learn more than 3 books a day which took me ages to read. One way to improve my cognitive and mindset about the knowledge that I am hunger all this while!
I have dyslexia, so being able to listen instead of read is a nice option. It may even inspire people who have a learning disabilities, to pick up a book and give it a go.
I love this app it gives me a quick overview of a Platora of books. I can then choose to download the full book if I want to dive deeper Into the subject. I would highly recommend it.
I‚Äôve never been much of a reader until I found this app, now I am listening/reading for an hour plus everyday. There are so many educational and motivational books that are changing and growing my views and values on life.
Easy to use and intuitive feel, steps you through the process.
I don‚Äôt normally have a lot of time during the day to ready a book so this is a convenient way to fit it in my schedule. Would highly recommend if you enjoy reading but you‚Äôre always on the go. Plus it‚Äôs always good to have a preview before fully investing in a new bookü§ì
I guess I said it all in the title. I loved reading in my early 20‚Äôs but in my early 40‚Äôs life is full with a limited amount of time to recharge, refocus and keep learning. This is where Headway comes in and it only take less than 15 minutes.
So far I am only on the free trial but I‚Äôm absolutely loving the content and how it‚Äôs kind of tailored to me. Everything is straight to the point and easy to understand and just echo mine of things I‚Äôm really in need of right now so thank you headway i most probably will keep going and buy a year subscription
it automatically charged the 1 year subscription price of $89 when stating that it will give you a free trial!!!
As a dyslexic reading a whole book takes valuable time, this app gives me the highlights & allows me to gain insight from a wide range of authors
I love being able to get up and read something that‚Äôs inspiring and helpful like these every chance I get or when I‚Äôm in a bad mood it is amazing it makes me challenge the new confident me that I can push through anything step by step..
I even feel like it‚Äôs bugging me to read the book thereby being easy to build up the good habit of reading great books
Reason why I highly recommend this app it teaches you lots more then you expected you just gotta pay attention without any distractions believe me don‚Äôt doubt it.
This app is excellent
The free version is terrible, you get to read a couple of pages and you can‚Äôt even go back to read those pages later, only if you pay for the premium membership. I tried contacting support but they told me I had to pay to access pages (not books literally just 4-5 pages) I had previously read and when I questioned why they closed the case üò¢
Text
This is one of the best apps I‚Äôve downloaded. Keeps me accountable with gentle reminders to maintain discipline in continual reading, learning, focus and growing. Highly recommended to anyone seeking to maintain a healthy mindset regardless of your goals.
Unfortunately you lost me when I realised I had to pay for a year . In Australian dollars that‚Äôs $197 . Monthly would be manageable  but  yearly is not an option  . It seems all your disputes and bad reviews are based around your annual fee. Why not consider monthly subscriptions that people can budget for . You would double your subscription base
I enjoy that Headway recommends books and challenges which I wouldn‚Äôt ordinarily choose  and I‚Äôm always pleasantly surprised by what I learn. It helps expand knowledge in all sorts of areas that I‚Äôd never expect to have read into. Thanks Headway!
"I previous subscribed to Audible but found whole books hard to focus on. Then I got into Blinkist which I thought was great, but got bored with it and the style of the book reading.
I‚Äôve found the Headway app my favourite of the lot so far.
They set challenges and select books for you after a detailed analysis so every time I open the app I see something I‚Äôm curious in.
Also feel like Headway has had more books that I‚Äôm looking that I couldn‚Äôt find on Blinkist"
it‚Äô has become my morning ritual. I‚Äôm time poor but 15 minutes a day, reading these summaries of my favourite books, is not only enlightening but productive in other aspects of my life.
The free version of this app is absolutely pointless. Basically no features that are accessible so unless you want to jump into a paid version, don‚Äôt waste your time
"Firstly, if you use the free trial YOU MUST CANCEL at least a day before the end of the trial if you don't want to contribute using it. It defaults to an annual plan with a huge fee of $139 which is a lot of money to most people.

Secondly, I didn't find any useful books. Lots of wishy-washy self-help books but nothing with meaningful content."
Headway has some great summaries for some great books.  I have so far only read a few and have found many gems & gold nuggets.
They have extracted almost $200 from my account and do not allow you to cancel. Apple are unable to do anything as the subscription was made directly. Shame on apple for allowing this predatory behaviour on their store.. I am now considering switching. I have had to cancel my credit card entirely.. AVOID!!!!
Time for or poor time management easy quick summary‚Äôs of interesting topics that can be access regularly help achieve goals and self improvement
Only just started with headway, but it‚Äôs great to get little tid bits of info on whatever topic floats your boat or insight and motivation in the little moments you might otherwise just zone out or end up scrolling needlessly. So far so good:)
The headway app is a reasonable price for a brilliant, insightful and fully custom tailored learning application and I would very highly rcommend using it!
This is a great app to get the gist of a book. It would be a cool feature if there was a second option for a more in-depth summary of each book, and choice of voice over.
Have not been able to cancel subscription that i did not realise was a subscription as i clicked to see what app was about and it automatically put me on a subscription.   When you follow instructions there is no where to cancel.  ?   Would like support from company to cancel before the trial expires.   But no cancel access!!!
"Awful subscription! Do not pay for it! The summaries are terrible
The voice of the reader is awfully monotonous"
Habits are not easy. Step by step.
Easy, simple and valuable..
Not worth it!
Good but also $$ and the tone of the narration feels robotic. It would be good to be able to change it. Other than that, enjoying it.
"What a fabulous book.
üò¨ So many brilliant ideas. 
My favourites were 
1. Decide what you wAnt
2. What is $$
3. Resolve to pay üí∞ (time, money, energy, action). 
Invest in yourself 3% - read, courses, learn, health etc 
You are what you choose.
Just downright fabulous. Have a listen"
"I liked the section with the Infographics so I subscribed to the app. Sadly, the infographics are an additional purchase!! 

I thought they were part of the subscription but I have to pay another $30.99 to get them. The developers need to make this way clearer.

I feel mislead."
Awesome. Such a great way to work on self development
Easy to read and learn.
Don‚Äôt ever join this. It‚Äôs fraudulent. I unsubscribed in May 2022 and just got a receipt for another automatic payment coming out. I would like these to stop!
"Signed up for this over a year ago curious to see if I liked it, signed up for the 7 day trail ONLY and after two days I found the notifications irritating and didn‚Äôt find much value in the actual product so I unsubscribed ‚Ä¶ they STILL charged me for an entire year and have charged me again one year later regardless of the fact that I have unsubscribed. 

Do NOT download this app. Absolute scam artists"
"Such a great repository of information for personal growth no matter which aspect or subject you‚Äôre looking to learn more on.

Good not recommend it more. With as little as 15 minutes a day you‚Äôll become a much more well rounded and informed individual."
I love to learn but it takes me ages to finish a book but Headway allows me to learn new, useful, life changing things everyday! I recommend this app to anyone wanting to enhance their life in a positive wayüòÅ
Really annoyed about this. I cancelled my subscription through the app. I was still charged $97.99!!!
I‚Äôve really enjoyed reading the book summaries and have found them to be practical and inspiring for someone who is low on time.
I commute so listen while I drive. I find it hard to listen to an American accent and take the info seriously. I would love if I could change the accent to Australian for ease and familiarity to better take in the book.
Loving it! Great way to start the day with some knowledge other than scrolling through Facebook.
Just started and already loving it
"Why would I pay for a summary when I can just google it for free?

Seriously I thought this would be free not another subscription service we don‚Äôt need"
They claim free app with in app purchases but that‚Äôs not the case it‚Äôs a yearly or monthly subscription clearly not free and that in every sense of the word is fraud!!!
The robotic sounding voices are so irritating I find it hard to enjoy the content. Shame as it is a great idea. Won‚Äôt be renewing.
I took a test and took me 5 minutes. To show the results it then asked me to pay. Not a smart way of charging people at all. It made me so angry that I deleted the app straight away!
I thoroughly enjoy this app.
This app turns 5 hour reads into 20 minute chunks of powerful inspiration! I can‚Äôt get enough of it. It adapts to your learning style and interests. HIGHLY recommend
What a great overview of life‚Ä¶ deep insights h th at helped me understand my emotions
I love that I can choose whether to read or listen. Information is so accessible in small chunks. I can pick it up whenever I want.
I can‚Äôt read a book on here with having to buy premium, and I always get ads for a ‚Äúspecial deal‚Äù every time I click something
If you feel like you don‚Äôt know much about life like me‚Ä¶this is a good app which introduces you to a lot of interesting facts in a short form but also a brief detail which you can later browse more or let along with the facts they talk about it could be your conversations starter.
I accidentally stumbled upon this app, on FB ad, and now it is my favourite thing! Being tragically time-poor, this is a life-saver for me! Thank you üòä
Good reads filled with helpful/informative perspectives but are similarly written. The key to this app I feel is putting the knowledge into practice.
I love the knowledge that you can build from listening to the books. It‚Äôs easy to do this when driving to work or anywhere else!
I‚Äôve found this app incredibly helpful. Love how the books are summarized, straight to the point! Getting a lot of value from it
They clearly push an agenda of gender ideology which I think is illogical, unscientific and damaging. They do this by promoting books that support gender ideology and promoting absolutely nothing that goes against it, please at least promote both sides of the story and don‚Äôt be a perverted big tech company pushing an agenda thinking you‚Äôre doing good to the world when you spreading harmful ideologies.
did the quiz and then it withheld the final answer behind a paywall. won‚Äôt be surprised if it holds any other features being a paywall too. waste of time don‚Äôt download
I‚Äôm really enjoying this. I have been listening rather than reading and I find it very interesting. It clears my brain and helps me feel positive about my future
All the knowledge you need to better yourself is right here
Reading has become more frequent for me recently and more enjoyable. The range of topics is wide and everything I have read has been inspirational. Well done Headway.
Charged $98 without a receipt, no email, no contact what so ever. If you download the app that‚Äôs it. No need to create an account. Apparently my email isn‚Äôt registered with the app but still my bank has been charged. Back and fourth for 4 days with ‚Äúsupport‚Äù still ongoing. Reported to apple
Crucial Conversations book sounds like a robot. Use humans please.
i really enjoy this app so much . It selected the right books for me to listen at any time anywhere . It is so pleasant to learn in this way.
At this point in time I have only used this app twice, but both times it has motivated me and forced me to make a small positive change to my everyday in a good way.
Great application
This is great for on the go or even when you‚Äôre working!
Quick lessons on important philosophical and scientific topics
"They are more take your money than help you in some way. 
They should give a trial for a month to see if it‚Äôs real worth and not asking for payment at the first."
The app is awesome and I truly learn a lot, even though I don‚Äôt have premium. The daily books that I get each day are enough for me, and getting premium is just ten times better! Highly recommend. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
Me gusta por lo practico, sigo la lectura y escucho, aprovech√≥ el tiempo
Great way to run through concepts of books
It‚Äôs really handy to have Headway provide these synopsis which highlight the important aspects of each book. Adds value you your day without taking much time.
Title says it all. You can‚Äôt do anything on the app until you activate a 7 day trial and then pay 117$ for the year! You can only look at the pretty book covers. This is a great concept but I guess the developers are insanely greedy that they can‚Äôt offer a free version of the app with limited functions to at least let people try the app before committing. Don‚Äôt bother downloading.
Ahora escucho un libro diario mientras conduzco al trabajo. F√°cil de escuchar y con excelentes recomendaciones diarias. Vale mucho la pena!
Give small example in summary where possible
Gives you the must haves from each book. Can be helpful if you‚Äôre looking for a template on how to achieve a certain thing whether it be success related, wealth, fitness, etc. definitely recommend this app.
Awesome
This app is great. I struggle to read as much I want, and this makes it easy and fun somehow. Recommended
The books are really summarised quickly. There are a lot of robot readers though. It‚Äôs okay
The app offers a lot of books that I‚Äôve been wanting to read. The best part is that I can read books in minutes. Saves money and time while gaining lots of knowledge.
Great books.
Love it
This app is awesome it keeps me motivated and has helped me change my life around it has fed me so much information I know more than a high school teacher, would definitely recommend the premium for any student in any age or level
Easy to follow information on interesting subjects
Reading and listening at the same time is my favourite way to learn and these summaries make it super easy. I also appreciate being able to highlight sentences that I want to review in the future.
Really helps you to read and to listen more of English books. That‚Äôs amazing tool not only to get precise knowledge from the authors but to upgrade your ability to perceive and deliver English speech. Thank you for elaborating such a magnificent assistant to improve English while diggening deep into the life‚Äôs wisdom and spirituality
Total scam charged me up for a yearly subscription automatically after a free trial and didn‚Äôt even notify me that the trial was over GIVE ME MY $133 back
I love this app
Do not get lured into this
The books are short and to the point with the option to either listen or read it yourself. You can read as many as you like as often as you want and can rate each book by itself based on your preferences.
They‚Äôre all easy to read/ listen to. Would recommend this app to whoever wants to read a bit daily.
Love this app because it is catered to me as an individual. It gives me the straight goods in a timely fashion. Life is busy but improving and growth is essential, this allows for both! Super grateful my friend shared it with me! Thank you from my busy brain, curious mind and nurtured soul!
Very informative, easy to read , listen of ur own pace.
Keep It Simple Stupid. Cuts out all the fluff, straight to the point. Love it!
Looks good so far! I am doing the trial to set my self up for success!
This app is really helpful! It highlights great insights from each chosen book! I‚Äôm gradually becoming more thoughtful, in this fast-pacing society, thanks to this app! Hope to see more collections coming up in the future! Well done! ‚ú®‚≠êÔ∏è
Free trial for 1 week then billed annually, ~120$ CAD. Skipped it to see what I could get for free, then a "special offer for 50% off, annually". Declined, and even after looking at another success challenge a 70% off deal. Imagine trying to scam people. Fastest uninstall speedrun out there
I haven‚Äôt paid for the trial but the daily quotes really help me and make a big difference in my life
I love how it compresses key points of great books of all kinds of self discovery. Is great to start the morning or finish the day with some proactive reading.
Whatever the mood or purpose, these five-minute stories with clear calls to action are just what everyone needs to help focus our days and fulfill our purposes
I listen while cooking meals or commuting. I always feel like I have learned something new and when doesn‚Äôt that feel good?
I find it doesn‚Äôt continue and pauses from chapter to chapter inconsistently. Also download speeds seem to be very slow. UI/UX is unresponsive at times.
App = goated
Full of motivation
I call it guide to life .Very inspiring and motivating.
Can‚Äôt control it with play/stop button on my headphones. Looks like no support for it, Please fix
I love this app! Got the premium and I am so happy I did !! This is exactly what I needed !
Very Informative, the way of presenting is so interesting. Very quick and straight to the point.
It‚Äôs my first day and I‚Äôm two books in already and I just finished my morning tea!  After I received my first trophy I did a little bit more just because ‚ò∫Ô∏è. It‚Äôs 630am and I‚Äôm looking forward to my lunch break. I‚Äôm amazed at how many books there are just at my fingers tips. Thank you üôèüèø.
App is good on multiple books review. Save time. Highly recommend app
With a busy schedule these summaries are a win.
"The app turns complex lengthy books into detailed concise short books that adds the same value and motivation as it would if you had read the entire book itself. 
Highly recommend."
This app does a very good and accurate job of summarizing books. I have been able to re-read past books in 15 minutes to get a refresh as well as gain new knowledge quickly and accurately from books I haven‚Äôt read yet. Obviously, a lot of the details are left out, but for someone who is interested only on the high level messaging of the books, this is a great way to gain knowledge quickly. Strongly recommend this app.
What a great way to efficiently work your way through your non-fiction TBR pile!
Audiobooks - effective and practical tools to inspire listeners to become participants and co-creators in the job market!
Not worth it
A wonderful app to become a successful person
I was charged for an app I did not purchase
This app has treasures beyond measure if you know its value. More than any material thing. This is the first time that I don't regret spending money on apps. This app is changing me as a person.
"I tried the app for over seven days and this is my review based on summaries that the free version provides.
The app has a good collection of books which are catalogued in a thoughtful manner. The summary readings are easy, mostly lasting about 30mins (I guess it is as per the time you set). 
I liked the daily reads and enjoyed it over the time I take to commute. Best part about it is that there is audio recordings of the chapters that you can listen to if you don‚Äôt have time to read.
Kudos to the team! I don‚Äôt know if this app has pricing for students that would be great!!"
It‚Äôs a good app, which summarizes the books for you, if u like one then pick it up from Amazon, to read the whole thing. Great app!
I like it, but it's too costly
That‚Äôs the whole review. Yes. Just‚Ä¶ yes.
The daily free reads and their selection of books so far been great
Even one robo narration is too many in my opinion.
As someone with ADHD, I often find it tough to sit through a full book. If I don‚Äôt finish it in the moment, I likely won‚Äôt come back to it... regardless of how much I found it helpful. This app bridges that gap by providing the perfect amount of listening material to keep me progressing and inspired.
"Vivimos en un mundo rodeado de tecnolog√≠a y f√°cil acceso a cualquier informaci√≥n que necesitamos, esto nos ha convertido en cierta manera en seres pr√°cticos pero de minima profundidad te√≥rica, leamos m√°s a fondo y sumerj√°monos en un mundo infinito de posibilidades y conocimientos, deja de s√≥lo flotar y sum√©rgete en este mar de conocimiento y poder. 

La lectura nos libera, la lectura nos transporta, la lectura es vida."
I use this app once a day before bed. Pick a topic that interests me and learn about something new. Great way to read , unwind and learn.
Great app.  Very motivational.  It‚Äôs perfect for my commute to work every morning
If you want learn fast and get smart! Use this! I‚Äôm a ghostwriter and this has helped a lot with research!
Best app ever
With all these sexist books and unbelievably bad marketing team I hope this app would go away
Never has so much power been given to someone in such short time. The books are to the point, anecdotal, and relevant. A few days in and I am impressed with the thinking and approach I have witnessed in myself.
Simple and easy financial advice that has been succinctly summarized on headway.
Finally a app to help me through the challenges/ paths  I go through life, that moves in into a direction of growth/ self evaluating
Love it, it is well made and easy to understand
Great app to learn something anywhere. Great to either read or listen to summaries.
I can go about doing housework and still ‚Äúread‚Äù and learn at the same time!
I listen to books instead of music. It just makes reading easy
I‚Äôm not a big reader, in fact I haven‚Äôt read a book in years.  I wanted to get into reading but wasn‚Äôt sure where to start - it was almost overwhelming to choose ONE book as the first book to start with.  Headway motivated me to start reading because of the massive variety but also because each book is summarized, allowing me to choose between many different options over a short period of time
I found this app to be informative and inspirational in a way I didn‚Äôt think it would. By giving me information and new insite it‚Äôs allowed me to gain a sense of hope that i too can change my life and turn it into something productive and fulfilling . I‚Äôve been depressed lately and been on drugs for a long time but I keep myself in this state of living . No one else I do . And I must change my way of thinking and break away from bad Habbits by addressing them and the route of them. If I don‚Äôt want to be a certain way I must practice self discipline and change my lifestyle and surrender my negative mind set because it won‚Äôt ever help me , complaining never made my life better . Just like stressing out never changed my circumstances. But only through hard work and will power and determination can I allow myself to be a better version of myself . Weather we think we can or we think we can‚Äôt we are right . They say fake it til you make it . If everyday I‚Äôm sad but I tell myself I‚Äôm happy eventually I might actually be happy and not just telling myself I am .
Voil√†
Easy to read/listen! Straight to the point and super effective!
I don‚Äôt normally offer reviews on these apps but I have to admit Headway is one of a kind. It‚Äôs a great way to expand my consciousness with all of the different topics. Well done Team Headway.
If you‚Äôre not a huge reader but love to learn this app has access to summaries of thousands of interesting and helpful books. Definitely worth the price if you ask me and they have lots of good deals and discounts so it‚Äôs hard to say no. Enjoy !
"Free week should say just that-free
Not going to sign up the way it appears to be billed"
I‚Äôm an auditory learner and so being able to listen to the books while driving is awesome. The only complaint I have is that there‚Äôs no way that I can find to make a ‚Äúfavourites‚Äù list without just deleting all the other books in your library (that I can find at least)
All the Instagram ads are fake and aren't actually representative of the app. Also, they bombard you with "special offers" if you aren't paying for a subscription.
The default subscription is a year. No reminder that the app free trial will expire. Automatically charged one of the most expensive subscriptions. Apple should remove this from the App Store!
Es muy interesante esto lo voy a aprovechar al m√°ximo. Buenas y oportunas las recomendaciones. ! üëç
I always want to read; I start books and usually don‚Äôt finish them. With headway, I have been able to consume an entire book in the time it takes me to drink my morning coffee. This app has been the greatest gift, I am so grateful to have come across it and can‚Äôt stop recommending it to other busy career professionals and parents that could benefit from it.
I really enjoyed this app! Was super helpful and easy to understand.
I‚Äôve learned so much from Headway. I recommend to anyone who loves learning in a short amount of time.
I downloaded this free trial to see if I would enjoy it. I was charged anyway and I hadn‚Äôt even used it. Read the comments before you do anything, I wish I had. Very disappointed in everyone involved, Apple won‚Äôt even refund.  Should be zero stars
Great advice and reminders
"So far my experience has been positive. I also enjoy the quotes you can share or ‚ÄúRemember‚Äù .
 Simple and to the point."
This app is wonderful. Nothing like a coffee and a great book to begin the journey of the day.
A great way to learn quickly, engage in reading, and stay on top of trends.
This is a scam app. They charge you for stuff you don‚Äôt need by making dubious links - one click and they charge your credit card on file without any further authorisation. If you contact their customer service, they will simply tell you that you screwed up and it‚Äôs their T&C. The money a company makes with no ethics will simply never be earned truly - and they will never survive! I can‚Äôt wait for the day they shutdown and be taught a lesson to do fair business‚Ä¶ Dont waste your money on rogue of a company like this. Don‚Äôt download their app. Don‚Äôt pay them a dime, it‚Äôs a trap! It‚Äôs a trap! It‚Äôs a trap! It‚Äôs a trap! It‚Äôs a trap!!!!!!
Love how much I‚Äôm learning by listening along with reading as well !
"Love to read, but not waste time ! Now with this apps, I get the essence of a book in a short time !
Al right, next book !"
I paid a subscribtion for a year and I somehow have acces to no books or any service‚Ä¶ getting in touch with the team is impossible. Total scam. I would have to buy the books on amazon after that???? WtFlying F!???
They keep charging my credit card, even though I have an email from them confirming that they would stop. I‚Äôm not using it for a year.  I deleted app. I contacted them. They promised not to charge. And today my card was char again. Highly not recommended.
I love the app, great selection of books straight to the point based on your interests. Great for self growth
For those that are not fast readers and got through school on 'Cole's' or 'Cliff's' notes for understanding books, this is not only a time saver, but helps get to the roots of a book and why the author wrote it!  Highly recommend.
Great way to keep learning without spending hours on a book
"Content was dry, free Spotify podcasts will give you the same content in a much more interesting way. 

Signed up for the free trial then cancelled after one day when I realized it was not for me. They will not stop attempting to charge my card even tho the subscription was cancelled on the app and I deleted it. 

Not sure how many times they‚Äôre going to try to charge my card for a subscription that was cancelled before the free trial was over."
"Recomendable por la variedad y cantidad de t√≠tulos y escritores, as√≠ como la diversidad de temas y g√©neros que contiene.
La posibilidad que ofrece de asumir retos de lectura y generar h√°bitos de la misma. 
Las promociones u ofertas que ofrece para suscribirse en el sitio son incre√≠bles, esos descuentos del 50 y hasta el 70 % son lo suficientemente atractivos para aprovechar y no dejar pasar la oportunidad de hacer una muy buena inversi√≥n."
Deleted the app and still got charged 90$
It‚Äôs anything but. No free option at all.  Trial is not the same. Mandatory subscription necessary at a  cost.
Loving it so far bought the year pass and it‚Äôs my first day so a year to go lol
üëç
Just only a day, and I have learned a lot. I wish many should join in to improve their language skills for the next level if possible. I would write more in a few days while I am going through reading. God bless
it is great app, could use more books and more things to achieve the goals but overall great app. good advertisemnt scheme for the 30$.
This application serves its purpose.
I use this to give me an idea of the books I‚Äôd like to read further. The bite-size summaries are incredibly thorough. There are so many books I‚Äôd love to read but just don‚Äôt have the time. This app allows me to narrow in on which books are most important for me.
Wonderful
"I‚Äôm not that big into to reading books, in fact I tended to barely ever read books. Two of the many amazing features in this app are the possibility of listening to the book, instead of reading it, and the fact that the books are quick to read, straight to the point and very motivational. 

I downloaded this app with the intent of changing habits and better managing my time, but it is helping me with much more than just that. I have had this app for over 2 weeks and I have not missed a day of reading or listening. When I don‚Äôt have the time to actually read it, I do my home chores while I listen to it. Cleaning have never been so fun and insightful.

I really am recommending this app to all my family and friends."
feels like I‚Äôve learned a lot about myself
‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èDO NOT INSTALL THIS APP!! If i could give zero star i would!!! This is the first time I‚Äôm writing a review because they just took 73$ from me without permission! They are scammers! First i signed up for free trial i wanted to see how is the app so that if it‚Äôs good i continue to use it by weekly subscription but the second time i opened the app it wrote that we have a prize for you i clicked on it and then it changed my subscription and charged me 73$ for it!!! DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP!!!‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
Having some issues at work and home has been very stressful, these bitesize chunks helped me get back on top.
Very good for busy people without the time to seat and read. I can do my dishes while listening to the books!
I don‚Äôt see the option to stop the free trial that will start charging 117.11 every year. Pls advise asap.
It‚Äôs a nice idea but it doesn‚Äôt work. If hounding me to read worked, I‚Äôd already be reading every day because my partner is always hounding me to read. You‚Äôll read if you want to read. You don‚Äôt need an app to force you to do it.
i love this app a lot, it has some great content !
I‚Äôm not much of a reader these days and I don‚Äôt care to subscribe to things I won‚Äôt use. This app however is not one of those. It‚Äôs been a great app with friendly reminders and nice short books so far that is great to enjoy with coffee in the morning. Only 10 or so minutes a day and you can finish listening to a book and possibly have changed your life. Really what do you have to lose. Great listening clean spoken words, and books you may not find on the shelf.
It‚Äôs a scam there is no way to stop this app from charging whatever it wants once you sign up.
Short and sweet
Me est√° ayudando a mi formaci√≥n como personaüôèüôèüôåüôå
I got charged 1 year subscription right after clicking on Free Trail.
Awesome I love it but so the books r just summaries and then u can buy them if u would like to go deeper into the topics that‚Äôs so cool I‚Äôm also hoping it‚Äôs just 2 bucks out of account and not the 117 right off the bat :) yippe knowledge
I start everyday with Headway. I have several catigories of interest going at one time from Business to Sex and I give each of one a few chapters a morning. Every single morning I am growing and learning in all the life chapters I want to! It‚Äôs a game changer !
I find myself being inundated by things that take me Down Various Rabbit Holes ‚Ä¶ Headway is my escape from that Noise to engage is right sized segments of books that inspire & educate. So Long TicTok, Ista & Snap ‚Ä¶ my wasted days with you are coming to an end!
I use it when i wake up every morning, it‚Äôs very informative in a style that‚Äôs concise and easy to listen to. I feel like in getting a little smarter everyday
‚ÄòWork smarter not harder‚Äô is perfect description of this app. Love it
Very easy to use and navigate
i wish improving your mental health was accessible for people who don‚Äôt have the money for it.
Every time I need inspiration, I know where to find it, thank you Headway!
Es mi primer d√≠a y la verdad me encantaron los res√∫menes!!
Recommend to everyone
Like many people here, I was ripped off. Came to cancel on the 7th day of the 7-day free trial period and then saw that ¬´ I had to cancel 24 hours before the end of the free trial period ¬ª. Just say it is a 6-day free trial then, and not 7. How dare do you charge a whole year of subscription 24 hours before the subscription period ends? Even if it‚Äôs in the small size terms‚Ä¶ No chance for a refund, app management never replied back. Biggest ripoff. Uninteresting content and disastrous customer service.
No more, no less. I recommend you try it.
If you're looking to change your bad habits or just make yourself better I'd recommend
I like to have access for multiple great Books and be able to listen. It gives me more quality time up at the end of the day. Sure am happy to discover this app. Cheers
I got scared away by the review horror stories of the free trial. So I‚Äôve stuck to only listening to the free daily book summary that‚Äôs offered on the app. The narration is robotic but is made bearable by turning up the audio speed to 1.25x or 1.5x speed. I still think Blinkist offers better book summaries. But if using this app for free for the daily summary, it‚Äôs worth trying out. I wouldn‚Äôt pay for a subscription to this app though. There‚Äôs some things that are janky about this app. Such as the home page not loading half the time. I have to restart the app to fix it half the time. The notifications I get everyday from this app don‚Äôt even list the correct book title. üòÇ
"I feel that the content that Headway provides is actually pretty good and well presented. I do have an issue with their approach to the hidden ‚Äútiered‚Äù subscription pricing. I understand that most apps and services get customers to join based on a reduced price; but the sheer differences in the amount of pricing, which goes down to $25 for the Annual membership isn‚Äôt good. I joined when offered 50% off; but when you realize how low it could have gone (based on the list of prices that you can review after), I was left feeling like a chump. 

I think you should either remove that list altogether or keep it to 100% price or 50% off. Having all those other prices visible just makes subscribers feel like they‚Äôve been ripped off."
You recommend rich dad poor dad, which I found to be absolute garbage advice and actually setting people off on the wrong foot. Had to delete app immediately.
The free version gets you 1 preselected read each day. You can‚Äôt read anything else, or do anything else in the app. The pricing structure is also strange. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúweekly‚Äù, ‚Äúmonthly‚Äù or ‚Äúyearly‚Äù it‚Äôs for a number of weeks, or a number of months.
Every 5 mins I have to close and reopen because it just stops playing. Half the time I can‚Äôt get it restarted. I‚Äôm completely fed up and want a refund. It‚Äôs unusable. The content might be great but if I can‚Äôt get the thing to play, it‚Äôs useless to me.
Thankfully I didn‚Äôt get suckered into their free trial so they never had my financial information. The free version is pathetically limited. I couldn‚Äôt do anything on the app without it reminding me that it would give me ever increasing discounts the more I denied them my financial information- it honestly came off as both annoying and desperate. Could barely do anything on the free version. Deleted after a few minutes - bad app.
Love the app except for the lack of variety in ‚Äòreaders‚Äô; seems Headway uses only a few voiceover actors; please give more variety of voices. Thank You!
"turns out to be not worth it at all. Charge before renewal date and can‚Äôt get a refund 

Not a good app"
First off, I like the fact that I feel good about being able to read the synopsis of 1 book per day. I feel like it boosts my intelligence at a faster rate and if I like the book enough, I can purchase it. The summaries are great. I really like reading the summaries with the narrator. The ideas and concepts just stick. I also like the streaks to keep me on track every day. So far, really liking this app!
"Complete scam. It offers a 7 day free trial and charges the full yearly amount instantly. I cancelled the renewal and now have to dispute the charge with apple, and if it doesn't work I will do a credit card dispute. I've NEVER had this problem with any other free trial with other apps. And a mental health improvement type app out of all things! You really did wonders for my mental health today guys. As if I'd blind buy something for 135$. Beware.

Response update : It's not apple's fault. I'm telling you that it clearly said free trial and I was charged on the SAME DAY, INSTANTLY, for a whole year subscription. No confusion about if I cancelled on time and all. Apple was also confused that this happened, they helped reversing the charges and it took days before i got my money back but I had the app total for less than a free trial duration. I know it said I wouldn't be charged, that's why I did it and that's why I was angry. Hope you can see your responsibility and fixed the problem."
Fantastic audio books
"Ever wanted to read a book but you‚Äôre not really one to sit and read for hours on end?  Well look no further. This app gives you the main points or meat and potatoes if you will, all within a 15min period. 
I don‚Äôt mind sitting and reading but my ADHD kind of keeps me from sitting still for too long. This app seems like it was made for people like me. But even if you have a great amount of patience and concentration, you can still benefit but being able to read a lot more in one sitting. 

Thank you for this App!"
This app is brilliant. For anyone who loves self help books and doesn‚Äôt have the time to read all of them the summaries are detailed enough to get the key points across in less than 20 min. There is room for improvement; when it comes to narration it would be nice to have a variety of voices.
"This book like few other is skipping chapter 1 & 7. So I decided to rejoin Headspace despite of frustrations with skipped chapters (you can‚Äôt simply go back at all the chapters are missing. Same with Andrew Carnegie‚Äôs books‚Ä¶
Can someone look into this?"
Honestly, this app I decent, not good and not bad. Some of the audio books have a r ally bad reader voice and it just hurts my ears. I payed in the start because it was like 90% OFF !!!!!! Andi payed 40 bucks. I mean it is better than listening to music but if they fix all the bugs and get good voices over all of the books. THATS when it's going to be a good app. Overall, buy the pro version.
The app offered a subscription for $49.95 for 6 months. However, after I subscribed, the subscription email showed the subscription is valid for 3 months only.
It is so helpful, full of value and easy to use
So great for learning new things, im actually amazed even by the free version
"I wanted to view the app to compare with Blinkist, it said there‚Äôd be a 14 day trial but immediately charges you for premium access for a year. I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to see the book list, it‚Äôs not shown on the website either. In the process of requesting a refund through Apple. 

Very shady practice, I‚Äôll stick with Blinkist."
"Headway allows you to ‚Äúread‚Äù more without having to spend a lot of time, because it summarized the most important topics in each book and presents to you only the relevant stuff. 
And if feel it helps me save money because I don‚Äôt need to buy all the books I‚Äôm interested to read."
i love spending time with myself reading üòá
Awesome
I find it helpful to read 1-2 books a day on subjects I find myself struggling with that week. The little take-aways you get will stick in your mind and help you to be more conscience when thinking and making decisions.
Their method of charging is not transparent and is basically nefarious. They wont't provide refunds. I would suggest not even clicking on t the app for fear of behind charged. I'm sure there are many other book sites with more aboveboard practices.
This app enables you to keep up with the best books available today at a fraction of the time usually required in extracting its core message. I recommend it to all people too busy, such as myself, who may have only a few minutes to spare daily to gather essential knowledge but require it.
Its an amazing app
I started the free trial and after a couple days I forgot how much the subscription. I originally went into my setting to check where my subscriptions are since I used Apple Pay. There were like 30 options which included $9/weekly $12/monthly $21/monthly $24/3months $24/yearly and $159/yearly. I thought maybe they just haven‚Äôt updated there subscription options with apple so I checked the app and I haven‚Äôt been able see any subscription options in app. The only option I see is a ‚Äúgift‚Äù pops up and says 50% off and get $64/year. Where are the options and what‚Äôs the difference between them? The app it self is good tho.
Motivates me to better myself and learn more about myself.
I am a learning machine but I do not have time to keep listening to full books on Audible. I noticed that over the last year and a half I hadn‚Äôt used it, and my husband did. I run multiple online businesses, manage a family business, wife, mother, and chronically ill. THANK YOU SO MUCH for this platform.
This app kept popping up in my feeds. In planning my year ahead, I wanted to focus on incremental improvements and this collection of summaries and related infographics made it easy. It‚Äôs still early but I l*ke what I‚Äôm seeing!
Practical way to gain information when we don‚Äôt have the energy to research it anymore! There are also smart notes and ways to maximize learning.
I wish you guys would provide some sort of tiered billing membership service. This is my second account with you guys I love it. I was a top 76% reader in my last account. :)
Easy and handy app u use always, addictive honestly
They take you through some questions and then suggest books which you can‚Äôt listen to without another subscription. A con and a scam.
I tried this for a week and found the summaries hilariously disjointed and oversimplified.
"The idea is cool, but can‚Äôt get over the awful robotic/Siri sounding voices for their book and chapter recaps. Feels like sitting through HR training. Blah. 
Definitely don‚Äôt recommend."
"Definitely the absolute best way tool look at life. We are not unique in that fact we have problems. It‚Äôs what and how we choose to deal with our problems. The problems we choose are our own personal choice. And seeing our problems as challenges to work through, making us smarter and stronger for the next challenge we choose down the line. 

10 Gold Stars. I no longer give a ü§¨. 
üòâ"
"Updated: the developer response is a incorrect if you purchase through the website. Through the website there‚Äôs no non-compliance with consumer rights laws as the right to withdraw is voided by the contract. No compliance issues technically exist, though it‚Äôs an atypical buried in the agreement. I‚Äôm many other jurisdictions, the right to force alterations in the consumer agreement, such as force a particular arbitrar, is banned. No surprise why they‚Äôre located in Cypress, as it likely gives them advantageous statutes to abide by. Shallow product w/o any depth.

The company does not inform you of the merchant location, and the terms and conditions void your right to withdrawal, meaning you can‚Äôt make a return if you don‚Äôt like the app. Even if you did want to formally dispute this, because the company is likely not local to you, we‚Äôre talking standing in a foreign court, so they are less inclined to settle on disputes because of the inconvenience. My advice would be to get the trial, cancel payment authorization immediately, and then you can make an informed decision once you try the app for a week whether it‚Äôs right for you or not."
"First, from someone who does summary works, these summaries are garbage! You can find better work online for free or on Amazon for cheaper. 

Second, their billing and customer service is at best confusing and at worst/ in reality designed to scam customers out of as much money as they can. They will:

- Inappropriately charge your account 
- Misuse account and email information for customer service 
- Make cancellation difficult and confusing 
- Never offer a refund or a simple apology 
- Never care about any of us customers who are out large amounts of money for bad app and terrible service 

PLEASE FIND YOURSELF A DIFFERENT DOWNLOAD!!!"
Love the app
I love the summaries which are useful and right to the point. This apps allows me to get the most put of my reading.
Takes 15 to 20 minutes but with good information
They will charge you. No chance for refund. App sucks and total waste of money. So disappointed. Never wanted to resign for this garbage.
Really helpful. I really appreciate it so much
Everything is behind a paywall, not even worth the $70, bad selection, narrator sucks
Totally worth subscribing!
"Some really inspirational good books a few boring ones buy they aren't going to all be
To my liking"
This App was able to send me a ‚Äûtime sensitive‚Äú notification about a ‚Äû50% off promotion on the yearly subscription price‚Äú, even though I have turned off notifications. This is either an iOS bug or the developer found a way to bypass notifications preferences. In any way it‚Äôs a disturbing behavior. Weirdly the notification showed the AppStore icon instead of the App‚Äòs icon, which is the reason I click it.
The idea of the app is great, but there are some improvements to make. The audio books sound very robotic and are hard to follow sometimes. The summaries are good, but also feel a bit incomplete at times. Also, be mindful that by no means can reading a book ever be replaced by a 2-page summary, and you‚Äôd be lying to yourself if you thought that when downloading this app. If you want a glance into a certain topic, this might be a good place to start, before you pick up other reading material to actually get engaged with. Also, it might be useful to people who really don‚Äôt have the time for reading or even listening to a whole audiobook, yet I feel like reading only a fraction of what should be a good book, you only get a fraction of the depth and knowledge. All in all, this app could be a great tool, just watch your expectations and be aware that this is not a replacement of books, just a good addition to widening your horizons.
Man muss einen Tag vor dem Ende der Probezeit k√ºndigen, was generell nicht deutlich gesagt wird. Wirklich schade!
"I really like the selection of books, the concise and helpful summaries and how the app presets itself to the user: the interface and handling.

A very few minor things to be improved from my point of view: some audio files I simply do not like. I find them not easy to follow. Might be AI generated voices but if so, very good ones. On the other hand, might be because I am no native speaker.
The key takeaways in the end sometimes are really not on the point. Some interesting quotes from the summary but too often not the key insights the book is about. 

But overall a very good app and service"
"Bitte um deutsche Sprache üòÖ 
Mein Englisch ist gut aber mache B√ºcher muss ich mir mehrfach anh√∂ren um es zu verstehen. Ich kann die App zu 100 % weiter empfehlen.

Sehr hilfreich, da man viel Zeit spart
20 Minuten am Tag lesen und damit sogar 1 Buch abschlie√üen, Hammer! Das Wissen aus den B√ºchern so zu komprimieren ist schon eine Kunst, bisher bin ich damit auch super zufrieden. Es scheint, als seien immer die Kernaussagen und die wichtigsten Dinge erfasst worden! Tolle App. Danke!
Weiter soüëåüèΩ
I have been really enjoying this app. Very quality books content. In addition, the UX is incredibly well designed and very easy to use. Well done to the team! Totally recommend the app to everyone.
A lot of content, very good summaries that you can listen to or read and very engaging gamification elements!
For some reason the whole app is in Spanish for me and I am not sure how to change it to English
Interesting, educational, informative. If you need some inspiration to help yourself growing try this app.
He le√≠do desde siempre y con un beb√© peque√±o ahora me resultaba casi imposible hasta que descubr√≠ Headway‚Ä¶ los res√∫menes est√°n muy bien logrados y lo disfruto un mont√≥n gracias :)
The easy to read and perfectly summarised books of Headway help me each day to improve and grow. A perfect investment in yourself!
I would give 5 stars for the content but the problem i see is in the audio description. It sounds very mechanical for some one who is used to hear audio books. No emotion in voice which makes it less attractive to listen. Thus 4 stars
a few bugs but other than that awesome
Very easy to use and user friendly
"I run the test ‚Ä¶. Then the app ask me to pay 3+ euros to show me the results ‚Ä¶ so I delete it üëçüèº. 

Would be more convincing if you give trial some days to people so they will see how the app works before even buy without knowing what this app doing !!"
Every book summary is just 14 to 15 minutes. Way too generic for any takeaways. The automated computer voice feels not really comfortable. During the process of signing up for the three month‚Äôs trial there is a fraudulent page designs which leads you to buy an additional - and totally worthless - infographics for additional 14.99. No response from the customer support. The whole concept is just about making you curious and lure you into the trial period for this absolutely useless product.
"I have only been using this app for 3 days and I am already quite satisfied with it. Such great content! 
I love also the options to listen to them, even if I usually prefer to read but when you‚Äôre having a busy day, it becomes quite handy. Very interesting app!"
Tausend fragen und am Ende muss man f√ºr die Antwort zahlen???
Erst Account erstellen lassen, dann den kompletten selbsttest durchf√ºhren lassen um dann darauf hinzuweisen, dass man die Ergebnisse der Auswertung nur gegen Geld bekommt‚Ä¶.danke
"I took this test, paid for it to get the results, but this makes no sense at all. 
The test results are not well presented and not well explained at all. 
Based on my test results, the first book I had to listen to was how to become Rich lol. This is so weird.
I thought I could learn things about me and then improve by learning about different areas, but this app really thinks it is smart and know what I ‚Äúneed‚Äù and then enforce me to listen to this. 
Well this app is not for me I guess, but interesting that people like it."
"Comfortable, good working, easy to use.
Absolutely not monotonic, but a question?
are books full books or re-righted to be shorter?"
"I recently came around this ad on Instagram, that recommended headaway and made me look it up more detailed. Since it‚Äôs only been installed on my phone and iPad for the entire course of a few days I cannot give a full review or experience to which I might be able concluding in some time however I feel like it makes it easier to gain the insights and key points of many books (unfortunately some are not available) without actually reading them. Personally I consider the summaries especially helpful in determining what books you might actually want to read fully and where a summary seems to be just enough for you. It‚Äôs a great way to broaden you knowledge and to dig deeper into your interests but also touch on topics that you might not have come across otherwise. 
One issue I experienced is that the function to share quotes, that are included and implemented in the summaries isn‚Äôt working. Here it would be great if that would be fixed. 
Last but not least - the best and well thought through function appears to be the repetition so that you regularly revise what you‚Äôve read or heard and keep it in mind that way."
Marked text passages as repetition would bring the 5th ‚≠êÔ∏è
A good summary of books is essential when you have no time to sit and read tons of pages in our busy schedule. This one just keeps my learning goals in line despite my busy schedule. Thanks!
Im not very good at writing this kind of review but the app‚Äòs just great. Question: Is there a way I can submit a book which isn‚Äôt yet summarized by you guys ?
The best it really helps
mid
If reading survey result requires abo, can you tell me before I answer the questions? You wasted 10 minutes of my life.
Very low quality summaries, if you truly want to learn do not use this app. Also there is no easy way export all of your highlight. I would not recommend this app to anyone.
Ich empfehle diese App wirklich sehr. Es ist zwar auf Englisch, aber ist trotzdem sehr empfehlenswert! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
One of famous spam apps . Lets you take test and then ask for subscription to show result. If you don‚Äòt wanna show result , do not waste time for users. Be transparent from beginning.
Great App but can‚Äôt really see the benefit to Blinkist. But haven‚Äôt used it to the full extend yet.
It‚Äôs simply the best.
It has a good variety of books and i really like that i can easily switch between listening and reading
Ich kann nur weiter empfehlen
Hab bis jetzt nur die Testversion. Ich pers√∂nliche finde das Programm sehr teuer, merke jedoch bereits nach drei Tagen eine Steigerung meiner Produktivit√§t
"And I continue to use it but ‚Ä¶

Please give more more than once voice to choose from. Some of those voices used to read the books are horrible"
Simple and straight to the points, Good For People who like smaller books
Gute Idee, aber die Stimme ist eine Katastrophe und macht die User Experience kaputt
Really enjoying my time
Why do I have Ukrainian flag on my screen?! We are getting sick of ‚Äúwoke culture‚Äù. Even if it was one of my favourite apps, I‚Äôm gonna unsubscribe, remove the app and change my 5 star review to 1 star!
"This app really helped me, and I‚Äôm really Thankful for Ukraine support. Thank you guy‚Äôsüíõ
Definitely recommend!!"
Thanks for helping me save time üòÄüôè
Ich finde die App Klasse. Definitiv zu Empfehlen
Really great job Headway üëå
"It always took time until I finished my books, but Headway makes it easy. 
Enjoying it and looking forward to the next books and topics in line!"
this app recommended a book to me by a far right conservative idiot spreading wrong + dangerous messages. WATCH OUT people. delete this sh"t.
Great selection and audio options
Super impressed with the challenges, learning cards, remembering buttons in the text. Great app for what it‚Äôs supposed to do!
Best way to learn and stay disciplined. Thanks for creating this platform
Top! Best app I have used. They always suggest the right book selection. Part of their profits they donate to those in need. üèÜüèÜüèÜ
"This has helped me enormously. I was in an empty place in my life with many responsibilities. Feeling stuck in many aspects. These great reads have helped me adjust and readjust in many areas of life. As a mother of three, as a wife, also with cultural clashes, self worth, relaxing and enjoying again.

I feel happy, grateful and once again, on top of things."
Informative. Manageable. Enjoyable.
Ich habe die App f√ºr die Testphase heruntergeladen. Ich h√∂re t√§glich bis zu 30 Minuten. Die App ist gut gebaut und sehr √ºbersichtlich. Die Stimme ist maschinell daf√ºr ein Stern Abzug
"Vorweg: die App ist super, auch die Zusammenfassungen gefallen mir super. 
Ich habe das Gratis Abonnement abgeschlossen und wollte erstmal vergleichen mit anderen Anbietern. Laut App bekommt man vor Ablauf der freien Nutzungszeit rechtzeitig eine Benachrichtigung. Leider nicht geschehen, so habe ich das Abonnement jetzt automatisch f√ºr ein ganzes jahr. Eine Verl√§ngerung um ein monatsabonnement w√§re hier auch die bessere Regelung!"
I expected the voices of the reader would be smooth and easy to listen to but it‚Äôs more like google translator voices
This app is wonderful. It is based on a simple Idea but still surprises me every time. I love the visual learning and that there are so many books. I have to say that I‚Äôd love to hear some soothing voices for the listening!
"If you think your clients are kind of dumb, you gave them a book summary and tell them what to think about the author/the topic. I‚Äôm still waiting for the app that gives us impartial summary. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt pay headway anymore and will delete it. 
Also Megan Markle bookshelf?! Come on! üòÇShe only reads tabloids!"
Clear and concise teachings, getting immediately to the point. Love it!
Anstelle von ausufernden Nachrichtenkonsum ist nun diese App getreten. F√ºr mich pers√∂nlich eine vielfach gr√∂√üere Bereicherung. Au√üerdem verbessert man noch seine Englisch skills. :)
Just if I‚Äôd be free:(
You get the idea and the most important facts of a book in 15min. And you can not only read it, you also can listen to them on your way to work! Really like this app
Amazing app where it ignites your self awareness and curiosity to learn. These 18 minutes summaries are unbelievably helpful, definitely worth going through.
Nice 15 min read each day
"I‚Äôve been dealing with some turbulent emotions recently as a result of academic and friendship induced stress. I‚Äôve spent around an hour or so strolling around my college campus in early morning. During this time, I listened to 2-books summary while walking around as the speaker taught me wisdoms that professors won‚Äôt tell you in class. 

This is truly a impressive app for those that can‚Äôt seem to find the motivation to become a better student/person. It is especially great for college students who are feeling stress, insecurity, and a lack of self confidence in modern society. 

I encourage those who would like to take some time off for mental and personal growth in other areas of their life to use this app."
It‚Äôs easy getting something we need from Headway!
"The app keeps shutting down 
I‚Äôm using XS with ios up-to-date and it can‚Äôt be opened"
I learned a lot in only few hours
"Un app ben fatta,si pu√≤ ascoltare ovunque 
Riassunti belli e chiari dei libri."
Esta aplicaci√≥n me ayud√≥ much√≠simo a mejorar en algunos √°mbitos y todav√≠a sigue mejor√°ndome. Todos los dias leo un libro porque me encantan y soy muy interesantes
This App is very useful to grasp the content of books that you are interested to read. The summaries are extremely well written and get straight to the point. I like the fact that I can use the App everywhere I go, and focus on books that are important to me even if I am busy and have a very tight schedule. I am loving Headway
Happy to have downloaded this app!
"Ho pagato per una app e per un abbonamento che non si riesce ad utilizzare se non pagando altri abbonamenti. Richiesto assistenza, mi hanno risposto con la risposta standard che trovi nelle Faq, completamente inutile.

What if I wanna pay weekly? Really lovely app but i dont wanna pay 90 euro in once for the rest of the year.
"Be careful when subscribing!
I signed in for the annual plan and wrongfully clicked ok on the Infographics option, which appeared right after the payment like a simple message. Didn‚Äôt realize I was buying something MORE EXPENSIVE than the app itself. Contacted customer care, but there‚Äôs a no refund policy‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm still hoping to get an easy and fair resolution."
"I simply love this app and all its tools. That‚Äôs a really way nice to hear the audiobooks, read them and become a better version of myself!

All books I read so far are damn easy to read and straight to the point, great job!!!
Easy to use, it let you be informed about information and stories that matters.
I just joined in this beautiful book app, and I already listened to my first Two books. Easy to listen and read, fast comprehension, even for me from Italy, it‚Äôs a great exercise to gain some notions and english skills at the same time. I love it!
It cost as a couple of books and in a day you can easily have them back, the audio resume function is awesome, highly recommended
"The app is great to have bites of different books and topics and then decide whether to buy a certain book to go deeper. 
Only downside is I can‚Äôt seem to update the 3 main topics/goals I‚Äôve set in the initial walkthrough: there should be a setting in the profile where to change them."

"I was curious to use the app for a week ande see how it go.

Then decided it was not worth paying the subscription. 

I tried cancelling the free trial in many occasions even contact the support for help and the still charged me the full year subscription."
There are tons of really inspiring, cool and informative books, but sadly you can only read 1 (randomly picked) book per day. But if you‚Äôre willing to pay, it‚Äôs awesome (or even if you don‚Äôt pay, actually)!
A melhor ferramenta √© poder acelerar ou diminuir a velocidade do √°udio
"I sent all requests from Headway support team in order to get move from my Iphone account to Galaxy since I'm changing of app. However, the staff just ignored my request. 
Other apps allowed me to move from one Smartphone to another one without having to request. This app is giving such a trouble."
Awesome app, if you can‚Äôt afford to purchase the full access you still get a free book daily.
√≥timo aplicativo
Eu amo Headway, pq ao mesmo tempo em que eu aprendo novos assuntos eu pratico meu ingl√™s !
Delivers what it ptomisses.
Extremamente caro para ser in√∫til
An advertisement of this app appeared on my Instagram, I downloaded and found it amazing. Really. It‚Äôs with it. I‚Äôm in love.
I signed up for free trial, but i want to cancel my acc with 5 days of subscription, and the app doesnt allow me. Such a dirty trick !
It is a great app! You can learn in a light way. I do recommend.
Perfeito
Noice
It‚Äôs really cool to read summaries. We can learn new things and many tips for our life and personally I‚Äôm using also this app to learn English.
"Dommage encore une application payante avant m√™me de pouvoir essayer!!!! 
La seul proposition est une semaine d‚Äôessaie avec demande de coordonn√©es bancaire!!!

An other expensive application without a (real) free trial."
Perfect.
Une semaine apr√®s avoir pris un abonnement √† l‚Äôann√©e, l‚Äôappli ne fonctionne plus. Elle crash d√®s l‚Äôouverture. Pas terrible comme fa√ßon de d√©penser 60‚Ç¨‚Ä¶
Il y a une vari√©t√© de choix sympa, mais la v√©rit√© c‚Äôest qu‚Äôune minuscule portion de ces choix adressent les femmes et leurs probl√©matiques. En outre, ceux qui le font d√©veloppent un contenu plus ou moins sexiste et r√©trograde.
audio books have been a way for me to indulge into an activity i thought was not for me. ive always had the hardest time sitting through a book and actually learn something from it, my mind continuously drifting away from the task at hand. with headway i think it gives me more tools to actually learn something from the book that i am reading while developing new habits. (sorry for my bad english)
"This app really helped me to read books and improve my reading skills as well as my English skills.

Good tip for not being afraid of the subscription fee, after having registered to one week for free you can change the one year engagement to a monthly one."
Good UI and UX + great content
I downloaded the app with the 7 days trial and was willing to use it for a few months after to try it more but the app automatically went to the whole year subscription! I knew it was going to be to not free anymore but I should be free to chose which plan I wanted ! It‚Äôs a shame . I want my money back !

Quand on a envie de beaucoup lire mais qu‚Äôon ne trouve pas le temps.
Over the past few years I have tried a few similar apps and couldn‚Äôt maintain a habit of sticking to the app. Headway has introduced a system that allows you to manage time on app and when in your schedule. I believe that is a great +

Great way to make room for self care! Would be the ideal app to have as an employee benefit.

I wanted to try the service for a week as it says ‚ÄúFree Trial‚Äù. Then they charged me ‚Ç¨89.99 immediately although the invoice still says ‚ÄúFree Trial. I reported my complain through App Store a week ago, but I haven‚Äôt gotten any response or anything.
Interesting and very good advices
"Libros b√°sicos y la mayor√≠a de los interesantes est√°n en ingl√©s. Una gran decepci√≥n pues no dec√≠a que el 60% de los t√≠tulos sin en ingl√©s!!! Sino no hubiera  comprado  el servicio.

I like to start my day reading a book from headway because it helps me finding the motivation I may sometimes lack. It makes me feel empowered and it reminds me everyday that the sky is the limit.
straight to the point and a worth of time! i loved that you can join challenges and read as much summarized books and have the same value and needed info! much recommended
This is the best app for introverts trying to succeed
Very god quality materials. Thanks for your good contents.
Would advise for someone naturally curious ad it‚Äôs wonderful
It‚Äôs just an amazing app to add to the daily routine in living life with a purpose
I love it
Hi! I just wanted to say that this app is truly amazing! I‚Äôve been using it for a few weeks and i felt like my life has settled down. You choose your goals you want to achieve , to make your life easier etc..and everyday u have a daily reading book, u can either listen or read. It‚Äôs really relaxing and I should say that you‚Äôre making ur brain a favor by installing this app! Thank you.
"Subscribe. Subscribe! We have a gift for you. What is the gift? Subscribe!
Just pay and read stupid propaganda."
Offers you to pay every 3 mins. You can‚Äôt read anything unless you pay
"Excellent KISS Approach to books. 
Siple and easy to understand summary‚Ä¶"
"How come no tilt option on iPhone or iPad ?!

Are you guys serious"
If only we could spend time on such apps instead of social media
Amazing app for reading!!!!!
I never tend to buy this app and it was for 7 days free trial immediately apple charged me for one year shame on them I have requested the app developer at least change it to one month they have declined apple too This app is not useful for me and I‚Äôm not going to use it Please refund back my money
"I have joined 3 days back and I feel it‚Äôs so easy to use and cover as many books 
I usually read for an hour a day 
This app allows me to read 4 books in the same hour 
Highly recommended"
Great source for books summaries  specially that i dont have much time for reading
I haven‚Äôt subscribed to any offer but I read a free book everyday before I go to fly and the app is really good
It‚Äôs helpful and joyful
Like it
I canceled the subscription!!!!!!!! How you go and detect the amount!!!!!! I don't have thisss money!!!!!
I always want to get new information and teach myself but unfortunately I feel lazy to hold a book and read. Headway is  the best solution for my problem, I am so happy with it.
Awesome app
It‚Äôs amazing I like it
Very educational and fast
Muchas gracias
The best app I came across in 2022.
"Even though I had headway on my phone from sometime, I haven‚Äôt really explored it. 

This is an amazing app to read and learn in this era where people are not able find time to read even a small blog.

Great Job Team Headway"
Love it
It charged me without letting me know
Love the application, but female voice is unbearable! Can u please make an option to choose which voice we want to listen to? Honestly, when the book is narrated by that female voice, I‚Äôm unable to listen, it‚Äôs so unpleasant and super annoying. Everything else is amazing! P.S. Please, add more books about minimalism! ‚ô•Ô∏è
Amazing for our life style nowadays
Became a member few hours ago and gave already finished 3 books bringing me important insights never able to commit to reading a book fully, this app does it for me. I rate this service highly
They literally took money from my card for a year‚Äôs worth membership when I did not subscribe for that option. I want my money back!
I‚Äôve downloaded numerous times the past two days and it‚Äôs not working?
I recommend this app it really helped me by spotlight the great parts of books
The narrator speaks as though he/she has a plane to catch and also has an unpleasant robotic voice. Everything else in terms of content selection is great.
Feed your mind with this appsüí™üí™
I am quite delighted to have access to this audiobook
Is super useful, you can apply to daily situations and reflect positively on what is happening and feel better, do better and score your implementation process..
"It‚Äôs an excellent app, but I have a suggestion 
If the speed of listening can be controlled in increments of 10% it works better for non native English speakers."
Very good app
It‚Äôs ver helpful. It lead you how to use you brain the right way thanks.
I love reading short stories. So this is very nice
Good enough to save your time if u like reading but doesn‚Äôt have enough time
Really a great action for people who don‚Äôt have time to read or buy a book ! They can easily listen and distract their mind from negative thoughts! Great work üëå
"It‚Äôs quite amazing.
Quick and efficient learning from the best written material and years of research.
Great job by Headway Team. 
Kudos!"
It‚Äôs refreshing to end the day with Headway
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs my problem but I couldn‚Äôt finish a book, no matter how I‚Äôm interested in it. Headway gave me another chance to know what inside those lovely books in a very short time.
"This app is wonderful! Highly recommended!
A few minutes of daily reading such interesting and informative books have really helped me instill best practiques and given me the motivation and inspiration I needed to make a positive change in my life."
Great way to improve yourself
Es una audio gu√≠a informativa no cansa es corta y muy enriquecedora
La aplicaci√≥n headway es muy √∫til porque mientras trabajo puedo escuchar potenciando mis conocimientos.
Maso menos pocos libros, y muchos solo en ingles!!
Lastima que es paga sino le daria 5 estrellas
Suena gracioso pero pienso que mi adiccion a esta app es cada vez mayor. Disfruto despertar y leer los res√∫menes gratis, de los libros que me proponen. Muchas veces o la gran mayor√≠a son los textos que ando necesitando para el d√≠a a d√≠a. √ìsea valoro la investigaci√≥n de Mercado realizada conmigo ya que me sirven mucho los t√≠tulos ofrecidos. Me encanta c√≥mo est√°n organizados y la grafica de las tapas. En fin soy una adicta y fanatica.
B√°sicamente la mayor√≠a de los audios son pagos y en usd
Voy en mi periodo de prueba, por el quinto d√≠a y me resulta sumamente interesante.
Excelente plataforma
muy buenooooo
Muy bueno!
Me encanta el App y sus resumen‚ù§Ô∏è
Como siempre te pide una tarjeta para la prueba gratis de 7 d√≠as, y si te olvidas te cobran 60 d√≥lares, una locura jaja
Es muy bueno pero el costo benificio , no da
Es una herramienta muy √∫til
una buena inversi√≥n
Excelente aplicaci√≥n, √∫til y eficiente
Libros demasiado interesantes, lo √∫nico negativo es que no todos est√°n en Espa√±ol, el menos el audio, pero casi todos! Muy geniales, te ayuda a crecer desde todo puntos de vista!
Realmente es f√°cil de usar, la app te permite escuchar el texto, leerlo o las dos cosas al mismo tiempo. El ser vers√°til te permite adaptarlo a las circunstancias, tanto sea como sentarte a leer como tambi√©n seguir escuchando el texto mientras lavas los platos.
Acced√≠ a la suscripci√≥n con pago anual teniendo en cuenta el periodo de prueba, al encontrarme con el limitado contenido en espa√±ol le di de baja, ya no tengo acceso y tampoco se me reintegro el dinero.
Aplicaci√≥n que nos invita a sumergirnos en la lectura de una manera din√°mica y amena potenciando as√≠ nuestro saber.
headway es una buena aplicaci√≥n para adolescentes
Excelente como resumen los libros, ayuda a entender lo m√°s importante para posteriormente decidir si comprar o no el libro
Empece hace poco a usar Headway leyendo algunos libros que ya habia leido, y me sorprendi a mismo aprendiendo cosas nuevas, interpretaciones nuevas y enriquecedoras. Es fantastico!!!
Es pr√°ctico, le agregar√≠a m√°s libros en espa√±ol. Pero me sirvi√≥ mucho igual.
Encontr√© pocos t√≠tulos interesantes. Los libros que encuentro son muy similares entre s√≠, no siento que me dejen informaci√≥n sustancial diferente.
"Excelente camino para abarcar mucho material y posteriormente enfocarse en lo que realmente despierta el inter√©s.
Me resulta sumamente √∫til."
Espectacular‚Ä¶ lo mejor
Me gusta todo el contenido
Muy buena app
Ya le√≠ mas de 10 res√∫menes de libro y no recib√≠ ninguna informaci√≥n valiosa
"Muy buenos libros! Damos por entendido todo de la vida, pero cuando lees cada libro, sentis que est√°s nutri√©ndote y logras entender un 360 grados de lo que supon√≠as sabias.
Nada que psic√≥logo!!! Le√© jaja y entender√°s muchas cosas!!"
"Esta aplicaci√≥n me hizo volver a tener ganas de leer sin forzar y cansar mi vista ya que la descanso mientras escucho y la reservo para la computadora o lectura de documentaci√≥n laboral.
Eh escuchado m√°s de 10 audiolibros y uno es mejor que otro.
Muchas Gracias"
La amo, me hace la vida m√°s sencilla
Muy buena aplicaci√≥n. Buenos res√∫menes de libros
Baje la app a prueba una semana! Y autom√°ticamente me cobro el a√±o!!! 29.99 d√≥lares!! Me des suscribir ya que no fue clara la opci√≥n! Y no cumpli√≥ con lo informado. Solicite la devoluci√≥n del dinero a mi tarjeta!
Son peque√±os libros que estan resumidos y explicados de una maneroa clara y concisa. De ayuda para comprender muchas cosas de la vida diaria. Util si sabemos como interpretar lo que nos pasa.
"Me gustar√≠a que agreguen res√∫menes traducidos en Espa√±ol para los libros en ingl√©s.
Gracias por el servicio."
Muy buena app.solo les pido que no me manden libros en ingl√©s porque no domino el idioma!üôè
Es una app q te ayuda a conseguirlo ,para construir un mundo mejor
Resumen cortos que sirven para obtener conceptos.
Faltan libros en espa√±ol , hay pocos ‚Äònn
Me encanta escuchar los audio libros y la amplia variedad de material que dispone termina siempre atrap√°ndome!!
Buenos Tips gracias
Muy pr√°ctico!
Excelente selecci√≥n de libros para el crecimiento personal y profesional! Bien resumidos . Van al grano! Mucho aprendizaje! De la mejor app de libros üìö
Libros y Res√∫menes muy buenos
Hice el pago y cuando entre no habia libros en espa√±ol cancele la suscripcion y no me devolvieron el dinero. Un robo!! Alerta
Buenos d√≠as. Por favor, necesito ayuda con cancelaci√≥n de la suscripci√≥n. En suscripciones no aparece esta opci√≥n donde deber√≠a. Gracias
"Los libros en otros idiomas, t√©nsela que poder elegir uno el idioma en que lo quiere escuchar, al igual que la velocidad, el
Tono,  la rapidez, y si es una voz masculina o femenina."
Tiene mucho conocimiento motivador
"Not only does it reading more interesting by picking the great material up for my taste, but it also is written in a good language, that one can broaden his vocabulary. It‚Äôs also made in a very easy way to note inspiring ideas as well as marking new words for oneself. 
Really looking forward to explore even more into this app."
"Man macht einen test und muss dann f√ºr das Ergebnis 20 euro zahlen ohne das vorher zu wissen.
Absolut keine Empfehlung"
this app actually helps me getting better in life‚Ä¶ the only thing missing is to switch languges to for example german

"Sehr empfehlenswerte App. Wer mehr aus seinem Leben machen will, ist diese App hervorragend. 
Ist ihr Geld wert!"
I love it , it‚Äôs so good and perfect
Aggressive pay wall
"It is understandable that apps are generally profit oriented. But offering nothing free like it is advertised not even a small function is extremely unprofessional and cheap. In addition, also asking me to subscribe in every step and then offer 70% off is disgusting. 

Not recommended!"
You can build reading habits easily
Best investment I made into myself this year so far. I can learn so much in such little time
"Honestly this is the best self improvement app i have ever seen 
Strongly recommend üôå"
Really great for building focus and I have an ADHD brain.
"Really enjoy Headway so far. Good summaries
And some nice visuals üëç"
A great way to spike your reading behaviour
Its a fun app but i cant open it anymore
"I had da subscription for three months and registrated it on my personal account, however the subscription in the application wasn‚Äôt showing. 

I contacted Headway via e-mail and all they could do is send me an automated message, no human response.

Then they ripped me off again for 30 dollars via an automated paypent and they won‚Äôt help me to register the subscription I paid for, DISGUSTING!!!

If I were you I wouldn‚Äôt take the risk to pay for their services because there‚Äôs a chance you won‚Äôt get anything and they won‚Äôt help you if so."
I think this is a good app and books, but hou need to pay 50‚Ç¨ without seeing any small trial??? Insane. Inwant to know what I‚Äôam signing for before i spent up to 150‚Ç¨ a year
Was wondering where the catch was, they let you fill everything in nicely and then you can only proceed with a subscription. No ad supported free plan of any kind. Disgusting.
Love it! Great way to have all insights, either by listening or reading. I recommend it
First they tried offering me a 30% discount and it would be 29,99$ for 12 months, then I open the app and they offer me a 50% discount but somehow it‚Äôs now 49,99$ for 12 months üòÇ
I love the variety of books and how many there are
I really enjoy the app and the books are quite interesting. Their advertisements on the other hand are very misleading. Ads on Instagram look like the app provides personality tests, but this is not the case at all.
Excellent book! I really loved it
I like the idea of app! First is a little bit stressful when you see that subscription but believe me‚Ä¶ worth every cent!
I purchased the one year plan for $29.99. Along with it I was also charged further $19.99 for infographics, I don‚Äôt remember buying. A hidden tickbox somewhere? I reached for customer support, but according to the company‚Äôs T&C no refunds are provided. In short - they might charge you any amount they see fit and you only have the right to pay it without objections. It‚Äôs a pity to see such a fraud scheme creeping it‚Äôs way into Apple store. PS The app itself does not worth a penny.
Good
I enjoy headway as I can review my all time classics in 15 minutes and discover other books which I later buy.
Tris app is expensive
Me encanto mucho mejoro mucho mi comprensi√≥n lectora
Muy interesante y aplicable
Tengo que resaltar, que hice un reclamo en la web de la app, y me atendieron muy r√°pido, una atenci√≥n muy amable, y me dejaron satisfecho! No tengo la posibilidad de pagar un a√±o de la app, pero la app y todo el equipo, 100 puntos! Muchas gracias!
"Incre√≠ble lo que hace por los que nos cuesta mucho leer un libro entero. 
Esta app merece m√°s reconocimiento"
F√°cil y practico de aprender
Libros actuales e interesantes
Is so easy to use and very intuitive. Nice UI, and also very good lectures.
"Even if the product can be good, the commercial approach is so aggressive that it becomes annoying.
The entire app is designed to milk you.
I get proposed a subscription plan, I refuse and literally one second after I get the same offer at a lower price.
I understand in the US this is normal, but honestly I immediately loose trust in a service that behaves that way.
Price what you think your product is worth. It‚Äôs not a Uber ride or the fish market."
Keep up the good work!üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº‚ú®
"This is another app that tries to trick users by asking pages of questions including user names and password before finally telling you that you have a 7 day free trial before they will AUTOMATICALLY charge you a lot of money.   It‚Äôs ‚ÄúI forgot to cancel-ware‚Äù. 

If this app is so good, why do the developers need to trick users by hoping they will forget to cancel after 7 days?

Honest apps that people actually want allow users to opt-in to pay at the end of a free trial.   

Hoping that users will try the app for free and then forget to cancel before the 7 days is up is scammy as f..k.  

Because of this I am deleting the app without even testing it.  I wouldn‚Äôt trust myself to remember to cancel.  

Goodbye developers. Have a nice life."
For every interest something available
It‚Äôs amazing. I enjoy reading it every day. Slava Ukrainiü´∂üèª
Excelente para crear el h√°bito de la lectura
They try to get your money in a very sneaky way. My face is full of disgust
Please make more languages, caus i speak german and if I could change the language I would be faster and morw efficient using the app!!
deepl oder google translate integrieren wuerde reichen
App leider nur in englisch
"I assume it is quite ok for the average reader looking for quick a summary about a certain topic. But since the app is marketed as a growth tool, this is not what it is.

Summaries - per definition - contradict the goal of inducing personal growth, as a thorough understanding of the topics is required, not just an overview of the key takeaways. Additionally, for the price, the layout is quite dull and there are many formatting, spelling, and semantical mistakes.

Last but not least (at least while in the free version), the relevance and the 'caliber' of books suggested decreased quickly, the last 3 ones being really boring."
And I bought so many books that i never finished bc I was too lazy too read them all... LOVE THIS APP OMG
Conocimiento al alcance de la ‚úãüèΩ
very nice app!
I like to learn and better if it is straight to the point
‚Ä¶to learn passively valuable insights.
"It truly gives insight to a lot of topics sich as motivation, mindset, habituary changes it gives you a lot of tools- now the change is up to you!

Thoigh there are still some bugs that have to be fixed the content is really good and information-dense over all self-improving topics"
I‚Äôm not sure if all voiceovers are made by AI, but there‚Äôs lots of books that only use the Microsoft Sam voice. Also I think the app needs a major addition: the ability to read from a selected point. If we accidentally change the chapter and we go back, it will start from the beginning again, it‚Äôs a little annoying. But overall I can find lots of interesting information.
"Mir hat die Idee der App sehr zugesagt. Ich hab auch den Fragenkatalog zu Beginn gemacht um meine Priorit√§ten festzulegen. Danach wollte ich sogleich starten, doch leider werden die B√ºcher nur in Englisch vorgelesen oder abgebildet. (Habe die app via eine andere app geladen, nicht √ºber den Appstore) Ich verstehe gut englisch aber um voranzukommen, m√∂chte ich diese lieber in deutsch, daher Abo sogleich wieder gek√ºndigt.
W√ºrde mich sehr freuen, wenn dies noch passiert‚Ä¶"
La manera m√°s f√°cil de leer lo que te interesa sobre los temas que desees en un corto tiempo, buena inversi√≥n del tiempo en esta aplicaci√≥n :-)
I have been renewed my subscription into a different plan which charged more because on weekly frequence. Quite misleading and dishonest. App annoyed me with constant email reminders and not so deep content after all.
Love the fact that you can either read the summaries or listen them. In general they are high quality, but of course the more content the more simplified the summary gets. I also like the action items they have at the end of every summary.

"Perfect to listen or to read book summarys. 
I get bored when a book is zoo long so headway is perfect :D"
They make it sound like it‚Äôs a free trial week with the option to cancel before the week is over‚Ä¶But then your credit card gets charged $96 the very next day after having signed up for the ‚ÄúFREE‚Äù trial!! And that‚Äôs now all! They make it impossible to cancel the membership!
"As soon as you pay the subscription the app closes and every time I try to open it immediately closes again on iPhone 13 Pro Max w/ iOS 15.3.1. 
The concept looked great but now I‚Äôll never know since the free trial will end in a week and probably won‚Äôt be able to give it a chance."
"Hola üëãüèª soy Nicolas y en mi tiempo libre escribo rese√±as sinceras de lo que veo en las cosas. Soy muy entusiasta, as√≠ que si me gusta algo, lo expresar√© con las mejores palabras, y si al contrario, no me gusta, ser√© educado y te explicar√© por qu√© hay m√°s opciones a lo que est√°s buscando. 

El d√≠a de hoy te cuento sobre Headway, mi compa√±ero en el aprendizaje r√°pido. Al igual como lo muestra en su logo, Headway te da la posibilidad de escalar a un nivel superior de tu conocimiento entreg√°ndote res√∫menes de libros tanto en espa√±ol como en ingl√©s. Estos libros se centran en el crecimiento humano, tanto espiritual, emocional, profesional, fisico, etc. Antes de buscar un resumen dentro de internet, Headway te entrega los puntos m√°s importantes de un libro en particular. Para algunos, nada reemplazar√° la conexi√≥n que se siente al leer un libro desde su portada hasta el final; es muy comprensible! Pero para alguien que considera su tiempo como una prioridad y desea de manera r√°pida obtener informaci√≥n para crecer, Headway es muy bueno. Adem√°s, si colocamos en an√°lisis el valor comercial de un libro, el valor de la suscripci√≥n mensual de Headway est√° bastante correcta.

Hasta me hice un plan para analizarlo!
Yo ‚Ä¶
- deseo leer muchos libros y aprender diferentes tipos de conocimiento para mi yo interno y para mi empresa (soy profesor y dirijo a otros profesores dentro de una academia online)
- no tengo el tiempo en este momento para sentarme a leer un libro de m√°s de 180 p√°ginas y mis recursos econ√≥micos est√°n enfocados en inversi√≥n en mi trabajo y el pago a mis compa√±eros de academia.
- por un poco m√°s de la mitad del valor de un libro puedo obtener Headway con cientos de libros resumidos a los puntos importantes (frases con ense√±anzas espec√≠ficas). 
- pago la mensualidad y obtengo todo el conocimiento que necesito para hacer crecer mi conocimiento, mi familia y mi negocio. Genero nuevos ingresos con buenas ganancias y tranquilamente comienzo a comprarme los libros en f√≠sico que m√°s deseo tener en la biblioteca del hogar üëåüèª
- utilizo Headway para recordar los puntos importantes de los libros. Cuando ya estoy satisfecho, eval√∫o si seguir utilizando la app o no, aunque estoy seguro de que el cat√°logo de Headway seguir√° creciendo por lo que espero nunca lo elimine de mi Biblioteca digital üì±

Espero que te haya dado una opini√≥n clara de los puntos fuertes e importantes de esta aplicaci√≥n. Disfr√∫tala!"
Genial, llevo un d√≠a con la app y la estoy disfrutando mucho. Se nota gran dedicaci√≥n al desarrollo.
Estaba ilusionada con esta app, se ve√≠a genial, pero desafortunadamente no fue as√≠ ya que los res√∫menes carecen de las partes m√°s espec√≠ficas de los libros (por ejemplo el de Padre Rico Padre Pobre)y los simplifican a un nivel gen√©rico, en el cual todos los de la misma tem√°tica dicen lo mismo. Por otro lado la mayor√≠a de si biblioteca tiene bastantes paradigmas ideol√≥gicos que se esfuerzan por inculcar y por √∫ltimo el servidor no es suficiente ya que el modo con audiovisual no cargo y adem√°s es excesivamente caro. No vale la pena!
He pasado muy buenos momentos leyendo varios res√∫menes en en espacios de tiempo corto. ¬°La recomiendo!
Si bien me parece genial que tengan los res√∫menes en audio y para lectura, me parece que deber√≠an aumentar la cantidad de libros en espa√±ol, ya que son pocos en comparaci√≥n a los libros en ingl√©s.
"La lectura es parte innata de la formaci√≥n de la cultura personal, est√° app realmente es un instrumento que hace aprovechar esos momentos de ocio y convertirlos en una fuente de conocimiento nuevo. 
Imperdible !"
Estafa ojo me cargaron dinero a la tarjeta sin suscribirme, no autoricen a mes de prueba a√∫n estoy intentando que me devuelvan el dinero pero No lo han realizado
A pesar que solo tiene unos d√≠as de prueba, vale la pena pagar por la incre√≠ble app, podr√≠a existir traducci√≥n de libros, hay unos muy buenos, pero en ingl√©s
Me ayuda a prender todos los d√≠as algo nuevo
Ideal este tener solo textos en espa√±ol para la poblaci√≥n de habla hispana.
Como puedo tener la app con todos los libros pero solo con el idioma espa√±ol?. Les agradecer√≠a mucho
"Realmente esta es una aplicaci√≥n que nos permite crecer de una manera √∫nica para nuestro desarrollo y crecimiento en muchos √°mbitos de nuestra vida.

Gracias üëèüèΩüòä"
I am absolutely loving this! I can get all the best bits of the best books and in very little time. I love reading and the saddest thing in life is that there are too many books and too little time, this app really helps with that!
"Sentido, coraz√≥n y Alma para que recibas la
Bendici√≥n00"
Me gusta este sistema de lectura porque leo m√°s en menos tiempo
Muy buena herramienta para tener al alcance de tu mano los tips m√°s importante de los libros de tu inter√©s, audios cortos, f√°cil de entender y de aplicar conocimientos.
Me ayuda con los res√∫menes y si me gusta mucho puedo comprar el libro completo as√≠ evito comprar y dejarlos
Love the app and it content
Hola pague por suscripci√≥n y no me deja ingresar a los audio libros
Muy buen trabajo
"No pongo 5 estrellas, porque hay muchos libros (quiz√°s la mayor√≠a en ingl√©s) deber√≠a estar una de las versiones en espa√±ol de todos los textos, en audio o texto.
El contenido muy bueno, pero hay desaf√≠os que no puedo completar porque no entiendo al 100% los textos o audios en ingl√©s."
It‚Äôs super easy
De las mejores apps para leer o escuchar una lectura‚Ä¶ a√∫n no me decido pagar la anualidad.
En la propaganda la app sale en espa√±ol JAJAJAJ PERO TODOS LOS LIBROS Y LOS AUDIOS ME SALEN EN INGL√âS, no me da la opci√≥n de espa√±ol ¬øalguien sabe donde puedo cambiar el idioma? Acabo de perder $10.000clp
Realmente se hace rico leer aqu√≠
Leer y escuchar a la vez ayuda mucho a mi comprensi√≥n lectora. Los res√∫menes son buenos, contienen la informaci√≥n necesaria
La mejor app que se puede tener!
Me ha parecido muy buena la aplicaci√≥n, pero la variedad de textos en espa√±ol es escasa
Baja stock de libros Disponibles
I am very disappointed with this app, I was waiting my 5 day cancellation notification but instead an expensive all year subscription came. I need a reimbursement because they never notified about my expiration day as they claimed to do when you subscribed.
Es simple de usar y hasta ahora todo lo le√≠do me ayuda e instruye en los aspectos en los que busco crecer.
La app te da acceso a TODOS los libros ?
Tiene muy pocos textos en espa√±ol
Pepe rayo
"La app contiene resumenes, no libros completos
Aun asi son muy detallados y hechos sin perder la escencia de los libros"
"Tengo la suscripci√≥n y duro menos de una semana cuando empez√≥ a fallar la apps, ahora no puedo ingresar a la apps, llevo una semana y nadie me ha podido responder a mi solicitud, favor cancelar mi suscripci√≥n de tres meses si no puedo usar la aplicaci√≥n.

Saludos"
Excelente
Muchas gracias me he puesto a meditar y reflexionar de lo escuchado
No pens√© que me gustar√≠a tanto, por tamaras horas de trabajo no me dedico a leer mucho pero con el audio todo es distinto, aparte que se oye con claridad y muy explicativo !
A√∫n no puedo poner 5 estrellas porque llevo poco tiempo us√°ndolo, pero tiene textos bastante √∫tiles de acuerdo a lo que yo especifique. A√∫n estoy en el periodo de prueba as√≠ que ver√© si puedo evaluarlo despu√©s
El lenguaje es el instrumento m√°s poderoso que posee el ser humano, y la √∫nica manera de ejercer bien ese poder es la LECTURA
"Si van a hacer una aplicacion con anuncios en espa√±ol, por que no traducen los libros en ingles?
No es tan dif√≠cil, y con solo una opcion para traducir que tenga seria una excelente aplicacion"
Te instruyen en momentos muertos, son r√°pidos y presentan lo esencial
"Me gusta las tem√°ticas que tienen, pero las voces no son agradables, son muy rob√≥ticas. 

Puedes informarte de mucho en poco tiempo.
Vale la pena, aunque no he contratado el anual aun."
Es muy bueno, solo recomendaria mas interaccion al final de cada lecci√≥n, con el fin de retroalimentar lo leido.
Pone a prueba la sensaci√≥n de bienestar de cada persona, invocando la sencillez de la verdad (an√≥nima) ante las poses de la moda y los tiempos contempor√°neos üò¨
Muy buena app, c√≥moda y motivadora 100 recomendable
Si los libros que recomiendan no est√°n en espa√±ol de qu√© sirve a los que no sabemos ingl√©s ?
Quiero cancelar una subscripcion que no hice y no me da la opci√≥n
Me indicaba gratis por unos d√≠as y de  repente tuve una suscripci√≥n anual que nunca hice y me realiz√≥ el cobro. No est√°n aparte todos los libros que uno busca y hay buenos libros pero solo en ingl√©s. P√©simo
El contenido es bueno pero la voz espa√±olisima a veces distrae
La mejor app
Bastante entretenido y did√°ctico. apreciar√≠a que tuvieran las versiones en espa√±ol de algunos libro en ingles. Por ultimo, Las voces del audiolibro podr√≠an ser m√°s org√°nicas, no tan rob√≥ticas.
Excelente herramienta para aprender cada d√≠a .
Buena app, pero no tiene una opci√≥n para elegir lenguaje y por defecto algunos libros vienen en ingl√©s. Puede llegar a ser un problema para gente que no conoce el idioma.
Es √≥ptimo poder escuchar contenido interesante y constructivo, me gustar√≠a poder acceder a libros completos y ojal√° a algunos de literatura cl√°sica
100% recomendada para aprender sobre diferentes temas, de forma r√°pida y detallada.
Tienen buena interfaz pero la voz rob√≥tica no es nada agradable.
Dijeron que era una semana gratis y me cobraron la anualidad de inmediato Ya no me interesa y quiero mi dinero de vuelta
"Buenos temas, y en algunos incluso se mencionan autores de otros libros.

Lo que ayuda a seguir profundizando"
Excelente app, sin embargo hay muchos libros interesantes que no est√°n traducidos al espa√±ol. Ojal√° puedan mejorar eso a la brevedad
Leo mientras manejo, es la mejor optimizaci√≥n de tiempo que he logrado
"Cuando el tiempo vale oro,los minutos invertidos para la lectura son una necesidad para enriquecer tu aprendizaje.
Esta Apps,tiene lo suficiente, para satisfacer tu curiosidad y aumentar tu necesidad por invertir a un m√°s en la lectura."
Necesario para desarrollarnos mejor en nuestra actualidad
"App Headway tiene muchos libros en ingl√©s, m√°s que en espa√±ol, los audios son muy cortos, no se alcanza a apreciar el contenido en profundidad. !
No me gust√≥, quiero un reembolso"
La mejor app sobre crecimiento personal
Me encanto
Estoy pasando por un p√©simo momento de salud en el cual me he tenido que someter a tratamientos en completa soledad. Esta aplicaci√≥n me ayud√≥ mucho ya que todo este tiempo postrado en una cama me ha servido para escuchar estos audiolibros y fortalecer mi mente para salir lo antes posible de este mal momento
Te impulsa a realizar actividades que piensas! Pero que en la vida cotidiana no lo haces, o lo postergas hasta que ya se te olvida.
Podr√≠a 0 estrellas pero no se puede, bueno descargue la app y nunca realice alg√∫n tipo de compra solo el mes gratituo y luego elimine la app y luego compro otra app y se me descont√≥ un plan anual de la app la cual ahora no me dan una respuesta sin dudas me estafaron espero que la gente no siga creyendo en esas cosas pencas.
Ser√≠a genial si fuera totalmente gratis
"Es un excelente libro. Me encanta poder leer durante 20 minutos. Gracias a esta aplicaci√≥n se cumple el poder pensar en lo que realmente quiero hacer, parar respirar y seguir ‚Ä¶

Gracias excelente trabajo!!!!
seguir√© aqu√≠ 

Mar√≠a Elena"
Please, I need to unsubscribe me from this payment. How do I should do that?
Me encant√≥ la aplicaci√≥n , si todos dedicamos un ratito a leer , vamos a ayudarnos a tener mejor redacci√≥n y ortograf√≠a, que con la tecnolog√≠a la hemos ido perdiendo .
muy bueno
Ahora soy una de esas personas que dicen haber le√≠do miles de libros,
Excelente aplicaci√≥n para emprendedores
Buena app, es f√°cil de utilizar, lo que no me gusta es el idioma de la voz que lee los libros, ya que podr√≠a ser latina, no espa√±ola, pero por lo dem√°s todo bien.
"Soy Sra mayor con diagn√≥stico  m√©dico depresi√≥n end√≥gena , y gran parte de mi vida   , he tenido que lidiar con acoso , de toda la familia ‚Äúhay que ser fuerte , todo lo haces mal ‚Äú as√≠ tengo pocas amistades , paso leyendo todo los d√≠as algo , ya sea escuchando por el tel√©fono los libros, ahora m√°s en no salgo del Depto , mago mis compa√±√≠a son los libros . Gracias por permitirme tener una opini√≥n .

Mi Norte"
Muy l√∫dico
Leer o escuchar estos res√∫menes de una aplicaci√≥n fue una idea concretada en un 100% lo necesario y lo que quer√≠as saber quedas claro y conforme a tu necesidad de entender.
No me gusta el formato no puedo cambiar el idioma a espa√±ol por favor ayudarme
"Me encanto el contenido aun que no responde mis dudas internas, necesito m√°s libros en espa√±ol y que expliquen aun mas el lenguaje, la comunicaci√≥n, f√≠sica, arte, filosof√≠a, o meramente algo que me haga revolucionar mis neuronas que est√°n tan constipadas con esta sociedad estupida.
Esta enfermedad que a todo nos afecta, est√° mentira impregnada e inculcada en cada uno de nosotros. NECESITO NUEVO"
Es una plataforma que facilita la lectura. Tiene muchos libros disponibles. Me encanta
Pens√© q no iba a usarlo ; pero es un hit
Su precio es muy bueno para todo lo que brinda, lo √∫nico que no me gusta es que algunos libros solo est√°n en ingl√©s. De resto todo Perfecto
I love Headaway because I can learn or study again books I love or getting to know new ones
Ojal√° trasladen m√°s libros al espa√±ol en la app! Gracias! Es excelente!
Lo que proponen es interesante, la aplicacion se ve genial, pero como es posible que ofrezcan libros para leer como eje central y noooo tengan un idioma tan basico como el espa√±ol para poderlos leer satisfactoriamente
Es la mejor aplicaci√≥n que han podido inventar para obtener informaci√≥n de los libros de manera m√°s clara
This has been the first app that has worth every penny I paid for. It‚Äôs useful, convenient, practical, informative and will always help you  grow in knowledge.
La aplicaci√≥n es muy buena y en modo gratuito mejor xq colocas libros interesantes. Creo q podr√≠an mejorar la experiencia con videos y dej√© algunos cursos en modo gratis.
Maravilloso
Hay que pagar por todo y solo te dan 7 d√≠as ‚ÄúGratis‚Äù a costa de cobrarte despu√©s 54.000/mes. Desastre!
Tiempo para todo!
Nunca he tenido la iniciativa de leer un libro y esta aplicaci√≥n ayuda demasiado a iniciar algo q jam√°s pens√© lograr.
Es una gran herramienta para quienes deseamos seguir en nuestro proceso de transformaci√≥n y no tenemos el tiempo.
La publicidad esta en espa√±ol y cuando pagas todo esta en ingl√©s .. esto deber√≠an decirlos antes para no perder el dinero
"Incluso la versi√≥n sin pago es genial y los libros disponibles son buen√≠simos.
Aplicaci√≥n amigable y f√°cil de utilizar"
"La verdad les comento que hab√≠a le√≠do varios comentarios acerca del idioma en donde muchos afirmaban que no hab√≠an libros en espa√±ol y dem√°s , a√∫n as√≠ decid√≠ comprar la membres√≠a y no me arrepiento; tienen una variedad de libros y muchas secciones de desarrollo personal y muchos otros temas en ESPA√ëOL , adem√°s que me sirve para practicar el ingl√©s as√≠ que a  ambos lados le veo ganancia.
La recomiendo."
I‚Äôve been enjoying it for a while now ! :)
I‚Äôm loving everything about it
Lo hermoso de estar dormido es llegar al momento m√°gico de regresar, si, de regresar y reconocer el milagro del despertar, con nueva energ√≠a, con un nuevo aire, nuevas oportunidades y en especial la gracia de co crear nuestro amplio y pr√≥spero camino. Despertar es morir a un pasado que fue y no volver√°, es ver un nuevo amanecer y es vivir el presente como un verdadero regalo de la Luz.
Me gusta por que me entero de lo qu√© pasa y aparte me ense√±a cosas de la vida
Amo headway
La verdad comet√≠ el error de comprarla, me equivoqu√© y no activ√© la prueba, pero considero que el contenido en espa√±ol es muy reducido, se encuentra m√°s en ingl√©s, por eso me veo en la obligaci√≥n de cancelar y pagar por un servicio con el que no me siento a gusto.
So useful
Bueno
Muy bueno el resumen del libro
Desde hace tiempo quer√≠a un m√©todo para poder acceder a contenido de valor de manera pr√°ctica, amena y divertida. Valoro demasiado los excelentes res√∫menes que presentan y  la manera como se presentan t√≠os o  frases  y datos claves incluso con la opci√≥n de compartir
Aplicaci√≥n en ingl√©s, te enamoran en espa√±ol y cuando pagas pasa a ingl√©s el 80% de la app
Informaci√≥n de calidez, r√°pida y con buen funcionamiento, econ√≥mica.
Me gusta esta nueva forma de conectarme conmigo mismo en esta aplicaci√≥n he resuelto varios de mis m√©todos antiguos y espero que el resultados sea eficiente‚Ä¶. Les seguir√© contando
Buenos res√∫menes de los libros que quieres leerte o no
I have requested a free trial, it did not attract my attention, I decided to cancel the subscription after 15 minutes, they have made a charge to my account for 1 year. and they don't give me a refund
Con esta app estoy logrando mi sue√±o de ser un lector!
Por el precio de la suscripci√≥n ser√≠a genial poder compartirla con ‚ÄúFamily Sharing‚Äù
Hiper recomendado‚Ä¶ facil , sencillo y lo mejor a la mano .
Es muy √∫til y sencilla de usar, me ha encantado. He logrado ahorrar mucho tiempo.
Hoy fue el segundo d√≠a que escuch√© un libro hasta el presente me ha gustado mucho, siento que faltan unas herramientas que podr√≠an ayudar a mejorar el programa. Gracias
It‚Äôs so helpful to have an easy and effective way to learn and get the best from all variety of books. Headway is a must to have.
Son audios muy concluyentes y cortos, informaci√≥n precisa y acertada
Lamentablemente supe que eran res√∫menes despu√©s de comprarla, res√∫menes muy cortos entonces mal para mi. No se si no vi la informaci√≥n antes de pero me decepcion√≥ total. No encontr√© muchos de los libros que en la publicidad anuncian.
Es algo nuevo para mi pero me interesa aprender
Me encanta esta aplicaci√≥n quisiera que todos los libros de su repertorio estuvieran en espa√±ol ya me he encontrado con varios que solo est√°n en ingl√©s
La publicidad es en espa√±ol y los libros todos est√°n en ingl√©s no tiene ninguna opci√≥n para leer ni escuchar en espa√±ol
Me encanta todo excelente todo los libros recomiendo  x1000
The best book resumes I ever saw.
Me encanta que puedes escuchar y/o leer mientras haces ejercicio, cocinas e incluso mientras te ba√±as!
Es importante agregar m√°s libros y autores
Espa√±ol para la pr√≥xima
Muy buena app, me ayuda mucho a no perder un d√≠a sin leer algo.
S√≠ tu objetivo es aprender tanto como se pueda esta app es para t√≠!
Me encanta, es verdaderamente f√°cil y r√°pido aprender conceptos pertinentes y profundos que ayudan a mejorar tu vida diaria
Resumenes puntuales y de muy buena calidad la experiencia
Fortaleciendo y creciendo como el Ser, vamos por mas
√ötil para tener ‚Äúp√≠ldoras‚Äù de conocimiento ü§ì
Esta app est√° cambiando mi vida
La voz es buena pero no es muy natural
Gracias a esto he podido tener informaci√≥n de libros muy interesantes en poco tiempo
Decid√≠ probarla y me gusto mucho, la estoy tomando como habito para leer
Estoy muy a gusto con la aplicaci√≥n, estoy tratando de formarme y esta aplicaci√≥n es de gran utilidad
Excelente voz y claridad en los textos
No se puede cambiar el acento? Me parece horrible y no permite una escucha agradable ni c√≥moda
Disfruto poder escuchar audiolibros y aqu√≠ encontr√© una forma agradable y diversa. Felicidades
Una excelente aplicaci√≥n que combina leer y escuchar con una agradable voz. Muy interesante las conclusiones y las palabras clave.
Hola, descargue la aplicaci√≥n y tome la opci√≥n de 7 d√≠as de prueba y dice compre la anualidad , yo no quiero comprarla no cumple mis espectativas, por favor necesito que se cancele esa compra ‚Ä¶:
"Ca√≠ en la promesa de obtener los libros y son solo rese√±as, no se justifica el valor por lo que ofrecen, deber√≠an alquilar los libros. 
Es solo res√∫menes muy muy breves de lo que realmente son los libros."
Es una muy f√°cil de usar la facilidad de tener voz y texto ayuda a que avances inclusive cuando est√°s en el auto
Muy buenos los res√∫menes
Realmente son rese√±as de los libros pero vale la pena
La aplicaci√≥n es todo lo que dice y mas‚Ä¶
Te motiva a ser una gran persona‚úÖ
No permite cambiar la app de ingles a espa√±ol y vicerversa.
Tiene muchos temas que te ayudan para nuestro diario vivir y enserio no inviertes mucho tiempo. O preferir√≠as perderlo en otras cosas que no te ayudan?
La mejor aplicaci√≥n, aprendes f√°cil y r√°pido aumentado el conocimiento
Es clara y te aterriza
"Estaba en una etapa de mi vida dif√≠cil.
Desmotivado y sin rumbo, siempre he querido leer pero se me hac√≠a muy dif√≠cil. Con headway es tan f√°cil y divertido! me cambio la vida."
Excelente informaci√≥n
Me encanta la forma de los res√∫menes, los libros que tiene y me aportan en mi crecimiento personal y profesional!!!
Pr√°ctica y muy util
Excelente aplicaci√≥n con un contenido muy inspirador! Muy recomendado!! Ojal√° fuera un poco m√°s barata !!
Puedes aprender nuevas formas de hacer las cosas mientras conduces tu auto
I find this app to be an amazing way to start my day. I read a summary of a book everyday and it‚Äôs an amazing experience
Directo al grano, productivo. Inspirador  trascendental.
Esta aplicaci√≥n nos aporta las ideas m√°s importantes de cada libro con el fin de poner en pr√°ctica lo m√°s relevante con el fin de obtener unas ense√±anzas para nuestra vida diaria en pro de los dem√°s y de nosotros mismos
Muy feliz de poder utilizar esta aplicaci√≥n.
Es un inicio muy importante para la creaci√≥n de h√°bitos de lectura y crecimiento personal
Necesito saber donde me puedo contactar para solicitar la devoluci√≥n de dinero de una suscripci√≥n que se realizo en esta app me encuentro con la sorpresa de q se d√©bito de mi cuenta 250 mil pesos destinados para gastos personales a q correo me puedo contactar para solicitar la devoluci√≥n gracias
Ocupa √∫tilmente tu tiempo, lecturas interesantes y breves. En mi caso ha desplazado a las redes sociales
Llevo un d√≠a con la app y he encontrado informaci√≥n valiosa que me ayuda en mi d√≠a a d√≠a
Insightful app, doesn‚Äôt replace the books but gives way to better book selections
"Hace poco tuve una beb√©
Realmente la administraci√≥n del tiempo al inicio se sali√≥ de control, con los d√≠as empec√© a sentirme que no estaba siendo feliz, a pesar de tenerlo todo sent√≠a que no ten√≠a un minuto para mi, as√≠ que trate de enfocarme en la soluci√≥n y no en el problema, soy una persona que ama desayunar, leer un poco en la ma√±ana o escuchar audiolibros o poner podcasts, as√≠ que empec√© a sacar nuevamente ese tiempo de calidad para mi y esta app realmente me ayud√≥ a organizarme un poco y a disfrutar de los libros que ofrece a sus usuarios seg√∫n sus intereses la recomiendo y espero le saquen tanto provecho como yo."
Una excelente app construye personalidades. Cambia pensamientos
Me encanta porque soy una persona con una necesidad inmensa de aprender .. siempre quiero estar en constante aprendizaje y me da la posibilidad infinita de aprender mientras manejo es un tiempo que siempre consider√© que pod√≠a aprovechar mejor. Pasamos horas en redes sociales sin nada de aprendizaje y creemos que  no tenemos tiempo para algo interesante, el trabajo, la casa , el gimnasio en fin tantas labores diarias que te ocupan el d√≠a, no nos dejan ver oportunidades como est√°s que sin importar qu√© edad tengas o cuales sean tus gustos y pasiones pues estar actualizado todos los d√≠as.
Me gusta que tiene buenos res√∫menes y que est√° disponible en espa√±ol
Un resumen es lo que debe quedar al final de una lectura. Al tener los res√∫menes, tenemos la esencia de varias horas de lectura
Todo muy bueno
Muy buena tiene muy buen contenido te ayuda realmente en tu crecimiento personal y en mejorar tu vida
Excellent way to review books to decided which read
"Por la prueba gratuita te cobran $30.000
Tengan cuidado"
Ya est√° en espa√±ol üëçüèª
Me encanta leer todo lo propuesto aqu√≠ sirve de mucha ayuda para nuestra vida cotidiana.an√≠mate es muy buena experiencia
Hasta ahora todo marcha bien, buenos contenidos en los libros y de mucha ayudaüëåüèΩ
Escucha y aprende
Me encantan que tienen muchas opciones de libros y que cada uno cuenta con sublibros que ahonda m√°s en el contenido
Solo est√° en espa√±ol mientras te inscribes y pagas el resto es principalmente en ingl√©s y si escribes no te dan ninguna soluci√≥n, si no hablas ingl√©s solo ser√°s v√≠ctima de este vil enga√±o y no podr√°s leer nada.
Muy buenos los res√∫menes de los libros
Obtener resumen de un libro antes de iniciar su lectura es sin duda lo mejor para abordar el contenido del mismo
Excellent
Abordan los temas de manera directa, y los res√∫menes que elaboran de los libros son s√≠ntesis concretas, f√°ciles de asimilar.
Me ha encantado lo que he escuchado. Pues no cuento con mucho tiempo para leer y esta app le lo permite. Otra cosa tambi√©n que quiero anexar es que he escuchado frases que aportan a mi vida
Buen d√≠a. Excelente aplicaci√≥n es muy beneficioso el buen servicio que presta. Felicitaciones!
"La aplicaci√≥n solo muestra los res√∫menes de los libros no tiene la opci√≥n de leer el libro completo
Que farsa"
Lo sustancial y la aplicaci√≥n pr√°ctica de lo que se ense√±a es lo que m√°s me gusta
Muchas gracias!!!
Information is very exiting and personal growth books inspiring and exciting. I believe it will make a difference in my development as a human being.
Excelente aplicaci√≥n para despejar la mente de las redes sociales
Esta app trae la mayor√≠a de sus libros en ingles, y no permite traducci√≥n
Excelente app ! üëèüèª
Es impresionante ver la agilidad del pensamiento asociado a los meros hechos que suponen determinan nuestros pensamientos y la continua formaci√≥n de car√°cter y de conocimiento empatico de nuestros equipo de trabajo para exigirnos el camino largo con la actitud de perfeccionar y analizar los pro y los contras de cada decisi√≥n y ejecuci√≥n de un plan
Esta aplicaci√≥n con los audiolibros me ha ayuda a mejorar en mi autodisciplina y con eso he conseguido tener una mejor actitud cada ma√±ana al despertar y sentir que puedo comerme al mundo. Me siento positiva y activa.
"Excelente App. F√°cil de usar. 

Buenos res√∫menes y buenos libros. 

Desear√≠a que tuviera m√°s voces disponibles."
Es f√°cil aprender y escuchar res√∫menes de temas de mi inter√©s
Me encanta ü§©
Me ha gustado los audio libros, dan ideas buenas y te ayudan a alimentar tu mente de forma positiva.
Excelente resumen
"Muy buena aplicaci√≥n. La
Uso en todo momento de ocio"
Uso la versi√≥n gratuita y la verdad es que es bastante interesante ya que lees por decirlo as√≠, un libro al d√≠a que para mi es bastante bien
F√°cil de usar. Buenos res√∫menes de los libros y la puedo usar en momentos precisos como cuando voy conduciendo o caminando. Recomendada al 100%
Muy practico
Excelentes libros que ayudan mucho al crecimiento personal y profesional
S√≠ al descargar dice Gratis y luego ya cuando has hecho tu perfil te salen con que es una prueba y luego viene un gran cobro, me parece enga√±o.
Redcr86
Me encanta üíï
Muy buen app.
Compre el app todos los libros est√°n en ingl√©s seg√∫n la indicaci√≥n el idioma se actualiza con el idioma del tel√©fono. Reinstale el app y sigue dando todos los libros en Ingl√©s. Agradezco sea corregido o bien la devoluci√≥n de mi dinero.
I started listening to headway only for a fee days and  already started see big changes to my life. I don‚Äôt spend hours to read a book. I can listen to a book while driving and really helps me
It‚Äôs ten outta ten
I was scared where is the catch, but the app is amazing and information I receive as well!
Its great but please add split screen
Thanks to headway app‚Äôs user experience I‚Äôm creating a brand new habit of reading. Instead of ordering and collecting books I don‚Äôt have motivation/time to read in full,I get to taste each one and then decide if it is worth the full read through. This works for me-my brain and work-life load like a charm!
You need to buy the subscription if you want to have at least one normal book. And the icon has the worst color combination I‚Äôve ever seen
You have to pay for a year subscription even just to find out your intelligence type. Deleted the app immediately
The only thing I hate this woman voice I feel like some Karen constantly talk to me ü•µ
Great app
Inspiring and motivational
"Super na procviƒçen√≠ angliƒçtiny
Bƒõhem nƒõkolika minut mnoho informac√≠ kter√© ƒçlovƒõk hled√°"
I got charged immediately, no free trial!
Easy, quick, helpful.
You have to pay to get any access to the app whatsoever.
Whenever you buy the 14.99 subscribtion everything buyable in the app automatically go through the transaction and u can easily accidentaly one button and BOOM -14.99 extra. and no refund. :/
"Worth every penny, if you are serious about your life.
I‚Äôve barely started, but the impact is already immense- WOW.
I feel like i‚Äôm beating ‚Äútime‚Äù"
I‚Äôm sure the app is very good and has some great content, but I ended up deleting it after only 5 minutes of downloading it. There‚Äôs nothing you can do with it without spending too much money.
"Taking a 30-40 question test was followed by a gimmicky ‚Äòpick-a-gift‚Äô screen where I was supposed to be manipulated into feeling lucky to get 30-50-70% off on a paid subscription - however, the screen got stuck as 70% was popping out.

I clicked the X to get rid of the screen and my results went away - letting me start over if I felt like it.

Rather than start over, I‚Äôve decided not to allow an app that manipulates to this extent to mess with my mental habits and wellbeing."
I recently purchased this app. The voices are robotic and no good. And I was charged twice! Please sort this out and refund me one of my payments.
‚Ä¶ But the reading voices are so terrible (really wonder whether it‚Äôs a robot) that they just ruin the whole experience. I regret paying for the app.
The speaker sounds like a robot.
Love this app. Great summaries allowing you to understand the full content but yet focused on the conclusions
"It doesn‚Äôt substitute reading the actual book. However it gives you an idea of what to expect if do want to read the real book and the program is great for recap of a book you may already have read. 
I give the app lower stars, because of the long gap between the chapters, it is so long that you start thinking you have pressed pause, 15 or more seconds remains the last word of the previous chapter and the new one. I can see no apparent reason why the gap should be beneficial in any way, perhaps there is an idea behind, I don‚Äôt see it. 
Otherwise the app is easy and intuitively to use."
For those, who want to know everything at once, but only have 24 hours in a day.
If you‚Äôre a person who Doesn‚Äôt want to be addicted to social media, but still wants to get the good knowledge. This is the perfect app! especially when you have goals where you need the important knowledge, all from Health to EQ and IQ!
Maybe make it optional to surf the catalog whilst listening. Maybe.
-and learn easy
Perfect app for those, who doesn‚Äôt like to read at all. All the bokks come straight to the point and you learn more in one book, than your teacher would learn a student in a half year.!
Me encanta esta aplicaci√≥n
Hay libros que quiero leer el resumen y me dicen que tengo que comprarlos, a parte de que solo puedo leer un libro por d√≠a
Quiero darme de baja y esta app no me deja, es un robo no de la descarguen
Soy un amante de los libros, y me fascina la manera que esta App me ayuda a leer mis libros favoritos.
This app only works in vertical view and the screen doesn‚Äôt flip to horizontal. Major disadvantage if you‚Äôre using a Magic Keyboard. Taking the iPad off to use the app is risky because it has no protection.
Esta app es genial, tiene t√≠tulos y temas muy diversos, lo recomiendo 100%.
"Hola !!
Una buena idea ser√≠a si implementaras los idiomas m√°s comunes , as√≠ lograr√≠as la aceptabilidad de mas oyentes , sin opacar el narrador original ya qu√© hay aceptaci√≥n desde el inicio"
Es fabulosa para mi esta App.
Gracias
Aprender es una moda permanente para aquellos que buscan estar mejor valorados √≠ntimamente y p√∫blicamente.
Me encanta
Me hubiera gustado haber encontrado esta App mucho atr√°s, es fant√°stica, justo lo que buscaba para mi crecimiento personal!
Puedes escuchar o leer un libro corto dorarlo de temas muy interesantes que sin duda te dejan mucho conocimiento del tema. Directo precioso  y corto
Bien
Great app!!
i would rate it with 5 stars but the app crashes once in a while, however, it's a 5-star app on ios
Lo utilizo en carretera y antes de durmiendo! Res√∫menes bien precisos!
Buenos libros
Lo disfruto porque puedo leer el resumen en 15 minutos a diferencia de leer un libro tradicional que te repiten lo mismo una y otra vez.
Son muy interesantes los res√∫menes üòç
Es muy pr√°ctico pero sobre todo te ayuda a cada d√≠a aprender algo nuevo aprovechando el tiempo.
Best Way To Get Knowledge in this information ege!
Es un concepto revolucionario y ellos han logrado combinar las buenas s√≠ntesis de los libros y tratan de entender muy bien lo que te interesa y sugieren libros que atinan directamente a nuestras necesidades y gustos.
Muy interesante!!!
¬øEn alg√∫n momento tendremos la opci√≥n de leer el libro completo y no un resumen del mismo ?
Son libros cortos pero concretos, me gustan en verdad, son muy buenos
Me encanta
Para mi lo m√°s importante, es que he podido encontrar un espacio donde tengo herramientas para mi auto superaci√≥n y crecimiento para ser mejor persona.
I‚Äôve learn a lot in so little time. P.D: I would read certain books complete or in their original version to get a wider view.
Excelente aplicaci√≥n y res√∫menes
Easy to read and listen, very clear straight to the point.
"La app es bastante buena y hace que me centre en mis trabajos mientras aprend√≠ algo 
M√°s"
Es muy buena app pero hay que pagar demasiado. No se que tan costoso sea para ellos los libros
Me encanta, ha sido de mucha utilidad. Las recomendaciones de lectura que ha hecho la aplicaci√≥n me gusta mucho.
Me encanta. Ayuda con el h√°bito de lectura y es inspiradora.
Excelente forma de incentivar la lectura y el crecimiento personal a trav√©s del conocimiento de los mejores t√≠tulos.
Hasta ahora la aplicaci√≥n me ha encantado, los res√∫menes son muy buenos, aunque pudiesen mejorar en la narraci√≥n.
Esta aplicaci√≥n es incre√≠ble para el desarrollo personal en todas nuestras √°reas, ya que contiene infinidades de libros que aportan un conocimiento excepcional‚Ä¶ üôåüèΩ
It would be good to have the app to be able to have it on Apple Watch, because when you use the Apple Watch for sports it helps not to carry the cell phone, the versions that are lte
Hay muchos libros interesantes pero la mayor√≠a est√°n en ingl√©s ser√≠a muy cool que los tradujeran.
Buen libro, f√°cil de comprender mediante la metodolog√≠a aplicada en la app.
Love it!
Pague la subscripcion de un a√±o y en un mes me  acaba de borrar la cuenta . Tipo reseteo la aplicaci√≥n que har√© ahora :/
It‚Äôs a excellent app
Me gusta mucho la app, tengo la version premium y me encanta la gran variedad de libros qu√© hay. Lo √∫nico que me gustar√≠a que a√±adan es que lo que resalte en los libros tambi√©n me aparezca en las tarjetas de recordatorio.
Aunque agradecer√≠a que algunos res√∫menes est√©n en espa√±ol, ya que muchos libros est√°n en ingl√©s.
La lectura seleccionada es excelente, los consejos muy aplicables, un me aburre, muy recomendado
I really love this app so much! It has made my life happier and easier. I love how fast I can learn about anything I want and then apply it daily in my life.  It really mades me a wiser person in such a short time. Very time effective app!
Muy buenos res√∫menes de una gran variedad. Me gustar√≠a que algunos libros en ingl√©s tambi√©n est√©n en espa√±ol o con traducci√≥n.
"U√±en tus manos tienes la posibilidad de aprender constantemente de libros famosos en versi√≥n extracto.   
Muy recomendable"
Es tan practico... como cuando lo tienes tiempo para leer un libro de manera f√≠sica. Tienes opciones como el audio o leer en l√≠nea
Me encanta leer y analizar la idea c√≥mo se transmite de los libros. Es muy f√°cil y r√°pido llegar al punto
Me encanta, hay libros que no encuentras en YouTube o spotify. Sobre casi cualquier tema que te interese. Escucho audiolibros cuando estoy ocupada y cuando tengo tiempo tambi√©n puedo leerlos.
Aunque llevo pocos d√≠as como usuaria, la experiencia ha sido genial, las recomendaciones, calidad de res√∫menes, me han enganchado todos los d√≠as. So far so good
Un d√≠a sin aprender algo nuevo , es como no despertar de un sue√±o sin un final ..
Estoy fascinada con la App, resumen adecuado, se puede escuchar y leer simult√°neamente o seg√∫n tu conveniencia y es pr√°ctico para la vida  agitada que llevamos hoy.
I get billed with the free week trial to the 1 year sub, it got a ‚Äúsale‚Äù but i get 89.99$ billed, thats such a lie!
Pague la suscripci√≥n mensual y me obligan a pagar la anual para leer o escuchar alg√∫n libro. Estoy muy arrepentida de haberla descargado muy mala app
"Hola, la aplicaci√≥n es buena pero deber√≠a mejorar dejando seleccionar el idioma del libro que deseamos escuchar o leer. Hay libros que uno requiere escuchar O
Leer y solo est√°n en ingl√©s o solo en espa√±ol. Gracias"
Excelente p√°gina
"I am rating the app low first because I was supposed to have a trial with the app and I was charged a full day before even starting the trial. I have requested a refund which the app cannot do from the answer received by customer service and I need to go through Apple. 
After two days waiting from apple I have not received a refund. 
I don‚Äôt recommend this app as it is not serious."
Easy to use and with good content
Me cobraron la suscripci√≥n el d√≠a antes de vencerse a las 11 de la noche, y me cobraron el plan de $90. No me parece justo que tomen el plan m√°s caro para renovarlo por default.
Una aplicaci√≥n que nos permite no poner un p√≥ster ador y crea h√°bitos un costo razonable para un proyecto muy bueno
Me gusta la aplicaci√≥n, es precisa recomendado libros como lo es con los res√∫menes, sin embargo, no pagar√≠a tanto por tener acceso a estos aunque valgan la pena. Los precios deber√≠an ser m√°s ajustados a la realidad.
"Reviso a diario la lectura gratuita para ver si me llama la atenci√≥n y leerla! 
Creo que pueden mejorar sus promociones ya que me parecen costosas"
ü§©caio y yucas
Compr√© la app porque pens√© que los libros estaban en espa√±ol, deber√≠an traducirlos.
Son lo m√°ximo !!
The summary of the book gives a good overview of the book to understand if it's worth the read
They have a really good collection. A great to way to get introduction to a book before going out and buying it. Even if that‚Äôs not your goal, consider these summaries as well written notes. You can learn a lot with in such a small time.
Short and informative books. You can read and listen them at the same time. Very comfortable way to learn a little bit every day.
It is an fraud application
It‚Äôs perfect for people who dont have time.
It worth every penny, it‚Äôs just fascinating.
When your ambitious mind can‚Äôt get enough fuel in today‚Äôs tight schedule, you can make a break and feed your mind on the go listening and reading epigrammatic on headway application .
A fantastic application with different types of books that helped me in several aspects in my life.
Full of interesting books with different genres
Me encanta la posibilidad de leer libros de diferentes areas y aprender de ellos diariamente
Hay res√∫menes de libros de todo tipo, f√°ciles de leer al ser un promedio de 9 p√°ginas y muy adictivo. Me encanta
"Escuchar muchos de estos resumenes aportan ideas que presentan otro punto de vista a nuestra realidad. 
No dudo de mi t√≠tulo. Cada 5 minunto con esta app algo nuevo aprendemos"
Muy importante para marcarte unas metas en las que no hab√≠as pensado. De f√°cil lectura e infunde optimismo.
Very good investment
No vi en ning√∫n lado que tras la prueba gratuita de una semana se me renovar√≠a por 1 a√±o, le√≠ que se renovar√≠a por una semana. Se me ha cargado todo un a√±o, y vi la opci√≥n de suscribirme en otra opci√≥n y se me ajustaba y reembolsaba la diferencia frente a la otra suscripci√≥n. Resultado: he pagado dos suscripciones diferentes y no consigo dar de baja ninguna.
"Tenemos un regalo para ti" S√≠, una subscripci√≥n de 40 eur/a√±o. Se muestra todo el rato. Es muy molesto, a la vez que enga√±oso, porque no es ning√∫n "regalo"
Estoy intentado darme de baja antes de que llegue la semana de prueba y se bloquea la app cada vez que lo intento. Pod√©is darme alguna soluci√≥n?
Perfecta, para mi
"No se puede escuchar nada del contenido sin la opci√≥n de prueba gratuita 7 d√≠as. Al coger esta opci√≥n directamente te cargan en al cuenta la aplicaci√≥n por un a√±o. 

7 Days trial es MENTIRA. ¬°Cuidado!"
I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è
Me gusta mucho , lo aconsejo
"Add Apple Watch support ASAP,
I want to leave my phone and just go with the watch sometimes. Let me know when you get it!"
Easy to read and very helpful!
Todo lo mejor aqu√≠
Una App con buenos t√≠tulos de diversas √°reas, para ayudar a mejorar tu productividad, incentiva al desarrollo y aprendizaje a trav√©s de lecturas cortas que aportan significativamente valores al desempe√±o laboral y estrat√©gico en el d√≠a a d√≠a. Recomendable.
Until now I listen to 2 books and really enjoyed it
"Esta app se ha convertido en indispensable para m√≠ que no tengo tiempo para leer todos los libros que me gustar√≠a.

Los res√∫menes son claros y te ayudan a saber si habr√≠a valido la pena comprar el libro."
Me siento estafada. No cre√©is lo que dicen de que se puede probar una semana gratis. Baj√© la aplicaci√≥n pero como era justo antes de las vacaciones de Semana Santa al final no entre por falta de tiempo. Al cuarto d√≠a empec√© a mandar e-mails para cancelar la suscripci√≥n porque no quer√≠a suscribirme por un a√±o. Me contestaron que no me pueden hacer la cancelaci√≥n. Porque no me encuentran en su sistema y con esto se han quedado tan pancho. Mientras tanto ha pasado una semana pero si me han podido encontrar para cobrarme la suscripci√≥n del a√±o entero. Una estafa total. No os apunt√°is a la prueba de una semana si no est√°is seguros que no quer√©is tener la suscripci√≥n anual! Me parece una verg√ºenza que la gente hace negocios de esta forma! Y que apple permite tener una app as√≠ en su tienda!
"Si no tuviera una subscripci√≥n de 89‚Ç¨ y fueran, por ejemplo trimestrales, habr√≠a probado un tiempo.
Saludos"
"Decid√≠ pagar la opci√≥n de un mes para probar la aplicaci√≥n, seleccione la opci√≥n de un mes y di clic a pagar y el cargo en lugar de cobrarme el mes me cobraron el a√±o completo.

Es una estafa te obligan a pagar la anualidad a√∫n cando seleccionas un mes. 

Estaba ilusionado de probarla porque me parece interesante y ahora a expensas de probarla, me parece una estafa, un aut√©ntico robo."
Me encanto
"Compr√© la app porque me pareci√≥ la idea muy interesante. Despu√©s de abrir el primer libro me d√≠ cuenta que est√°n en ingl√©s, aunque la publicidad a trav√©s de Instagram aparece en espa√±ol. Me siento totalmente enga√±ada. Ni siquiera puedo cambiar la suscripci√≥n a una semana en vez de un a√±o! 
Mand√© un email al soporte al cliente. Espero que me den una soluci√≥n"
Es incre√≠ble! Pero de verdad! Es como si en menos tiempo absorbiera mucho m√°s!
I do appreciate each dollar spent on this great app. Easy and funny way to get updated about virtually anything!
App imprescindible para gente que no tiene mucho tiempo de leer
Me encanta empiezo a cojer  gusto a la lectura
Muy √∫til a la hora de dar tips sobre crecimiento personal en forma de peque√±as c√°psulas
Incre√≠ble!!
En 15/20 min consigo leerme un resumen motivador, en cualquier lugar y de forma regular. √âs una muy buena forma de aprender de cientos de libros que ser√≠a imposible que me leyera por tiempo y dinero.
La √∫nica App que uso a diario!
Me gusta porque lo puedes utilizar en cualquier momento. Que estas en un sitio y no tienes auriculares, pues lees. Que estas haci√©ndote el caf√© por la ma√±ana y prepar√°ndote las cosas, pues te pones el audio. Yo lo utilizo mucho.
Love the platform, the variety options to read, the quality of the summaries. So great and simple to follow along and read many by month!
Me parece un poco estafa el precio que tiene,y m√°s del 50% de los libros son en ingl√©s,cosa que deber√≠an avisar antes de gastarte el dinero
Deduje que al pagar suscripci√≥n se me abrir√≠a un abanico de libros en mi idioma natal, y no fue as√≠. Mejoren que se pueda elegir idioma de los libros.
descargue la app por unos anuncios que me sal√≠an en instagram, consist√≠an en una lista de libros. una vez en app y pagando, busco esos libros en la app y no est√°n. decepcionante.
No hay absolutamente nada gratuito, ni siquiera una mini lectura üòÖ y luego de ver los comentarios que afirman que la app cobra 60‚Ç¨ al solicitar ‚Äúprueba gratuita‚Äù, tampoco me atrevo a probarla. Una pena.
It‚Äôs very insightful and it has helped me a lot to overcome my problems and achieve my ambitions
Has a problem with ios 15.4 (iPhone 12). App subsequently closes.
This is the only app for reading I have actually used. I have downloaded many and used them, bought a Kindle and got bored of it. Now I found this and it gives me the best suggestions ever!!!!!
Desde que se ha actualizado a la √∫ltima versi√≥n, no permite escuchar, solo leer.
Son un fraude, te dicen que tienes 1 semana gratis y te cargan la cuota directamente. Y si, si se puede cargar ya que lo hace directamente apple o sea que no me veng√°is con lo de los datos de tarjeta. He cancelado la suscripci√≥n y voy a devolver el cargo, no pago estafadores.
Automated one-year subscription before you can realise
S√∫per √∫til
LIBROS LE√çDOS EN ALTA VOZ
Una estafa, llevo todo el d√≠a intentando dar de baja la semana de prueba y no me han dejado. Al ser el √∫ltimo d√≠a, me han cobrado una suscripci√≥n de un a√±o y no me dejan cancelarla.
Ojo que da problemas para anular la suscripci√≥n y el servicio de atenci√≥n al cliente no contesta. Tuve que hacerlo desde el control de suscripciones de Apple.
Me encanta, todo, aprendo mucho!
Los libros m√°s interesante  tienes que pagarlo
Una App para poder leer y crecer a la misma vez
Great summaries. I listen to them while getting ready in the morning. I Enjoy them!
Amazing app with loads of options to read about!
Me encanta lo din√°mica que es esta app, y el resumen de los libros en 15 min me parece LO M√ÅS. P√≠ldoras de libros interesantes todos los d√≠as. Qu√© m√°s se puede pedir? Un 10
Para los que no disponemos de mucho tiempo es una herramienta ideal.
"Before I started using the Headway app, I use to struggle with books a lot.

In the last 5 years, the number of books I‚Äôve read is pretty close to 10. 

Thanks to Headway, right now I am reading / listening two books per day, and I‚Äôm enjoying the experience. 

Great app for non readers!"
Promet√≠a bastante pero el 80% son en ingl√©s.
"Estoy descubriendo esta maravillosa app , entre por casualidad me suscrib√≠ por error y ahora estoy encantado. 
Me gustar√≠a alguna ayuda m√°s en el uso y con las recomendaciones 
Gracias"
Me gusta su sencillez y calidad de lectura
Hacen un buen resumen del libro!
Muy bien
"He pasado directamente a la suscripci√≥n anual.Conozco todos los libros de crecimiento y desarrollo personal, y esta App me permite recordarlos destacando lo mejor de cada uno e incluso te da la opci√≥n de marcar para recordar sus mejores citas o frases.
Enhorabuena!!"
"Primero ofrecen gratuidad y seguido el pago tras una semana. 
Cuando habr√° leyes que prohiban estas empresas ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
No caig√°is en la trampa."
Headway es una app que me motiva a incrementar mis h√°bitos de lectura con sus incre√≠bles propuestas, simplemente me encanta !!
Muy efectivo
Resulta que pago esta app para poder leer o escuchar los libros que quiera y resulta que no funciona , la app no responde no deja escuchar los libros, as√≠ que espero una soluci√≥n.
La idea es fant√°stica, y los res√∫menes extraen la esencia de los libros de una manera sucinta pero efectiva, en cualquier caso no es lo mismo que leerse el libro entero, porque solo ‚Äúvuela por encima‚Äù de las ideas principales pero fomenta la lectura y la indagaci√≥n profunda si un tema te interesa en particular. A mejorar ; m√°s t√≠tulos es castellano , por favor , falta mucho contenido en este idioma.
No quiero pagar ni mucho menos es m√°s no acepte la prueba e igual abri√≥, necesito eliminar esto sin que me cobren por favor como hago? No quiero la App
Voy en el tren, camino de mis vacaciones‚Ä¶.tengo un rato a mitad de tarde‚Ä¶cualquier momento es perfecto, porque solo necesito eso‚Äùun momento‚Äù‚Äù un ratito para leer unos res√∫menes estupendos de libros seleccionados a mi gusto‚Ä¶maravillosa app, de verdad, ME ENCANTA!! üòä‚ô•Ô∏è
üëè‚ù§Ô∏è
Pone que es en espa√±ol per√≤ no se puede configurar idioma
Muy buen camino para aprender ‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô†Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Me encanta la variedad de temas y la ayuda que te aportan.
Great and make reading very friendly. Amazing
Los libros son cortos , deber√≠an estar completos. üòä
Muy interesante los libros las opciones y facilidades, lo √∫nico que mejoraria tener la opci√≥n de o√≠rlo en diferentes voces o k no todos los libros sean con el mismo doblador
Desgraciadamente la traducci√≥n al espa√±ol la lee una voz rob√≥tica que no vocaliza ni se entiende muy bien. Es una pena porque ya hay sistemas de lectura m√°s naturales pero parece que no se han esforzado en actualizarlo y es un parche poco trabajado. Encima el precio es caro para que dejen de lado un detalle tan importante
They advertise books in Spanish that they don't have.  It‚Äôs a gotcha.
Mi dosis de conocimiento diario
"Herramienta √∫til para obligarte a leer de forma constante. Contenido variado que se ajusta a tus intereses.
Cuando no tienes tiempo para leer, puedes escuchar la parte del libro que te toca ese d√≠a."
Tiene muchos textos en ingles sin estar traducidos, lo considero un flaco favor a nuestro idioma. En los √∫ltimos tiempos ha mejorado bastante, he hecho una suscripci√≥n por un a√±o.
"After having subscribed to Headway Premium‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶and having devoted quite a few hours to choose my books in my Library‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Bearing in mind that those books were interesting‚Ä¶ I then logged on, creating an account‚Ä¶ BUT, all the chosen books in my Library disappeared !!! ‚Ä¶ without prior notice!  How can I retrieve them? 

When I log out‚Ä¶ my Library appears !!! ‚Ä¶BUT how can I include it into my account?

I improve my Review from 2‚≠êÔ∏è to 3‚≠êÔ∏è.
When this issue will be solved, I‚Äôll provide 4 or 5‚≠êÔ∏è to Headway.

 Silver_evs / University Professor and Coach"
Fant√°stica fuente de informaci√≥n para cuando tienes poco tiempo.
Da la posibilidad de tener un peque√±o resumen con ideas muy concisas de algunos temas que puedan ser de tu inter√©s
Muy buenos libros resumidos, un acierto total
Malditos estafadores y Apple Store por consentirlo
Si no se escucha todo en espa√±ol no me interesa. Si ,si se escucha tono en Espa√±ol mel√≥ comprar√© .
Mejor inversi√≥n! Sin duda! Estoy encantada !!!
La app es genial, lo √∫nico a corregir ser√≠a el idioma en muchos libros, ser√≠a interesante tenga la opci√≥n de traducci√≥n.
There is nothing free in the app so think before downloading and then being bombarded with continuously to sell you subscriptions.
Estoy muy emocionado y a la vez agradecido con headway, he descubierto en mi el poder de la lectura y lo que podemos aprender y mejorar en nosotros mismos‚Ä¶ gracias a todo el contenido que se encuentra en la aplicaci√≥n. Muy RECOMENDADO
Me gusta, es din√°mico, f√°cil de usar y lo que mas me gusta es que resume muy bien los libros, pudriendo elegir cual leer√≠as al completo.
Nada gratis una demo y a pagar no entiendo porque permiten a las app mostrar que son gratis cuando solo dan una demo hacienda perder el tiempo
The app is great app!! but in iPad is only available on Portrait version. And I work with the iPad in landscape mood.
mi nueva app favorita
Si es buena idea los audiolibros cortos, sin embargo, lo que no me gusta es que despu√©s de pagar te encuentres que muchos de ellos est√°n en ingl√©s
Me han cobrado una suscripci√≥n que yo no quer√≠a y no hay manera de que me lo reembolsen?
"The app is very good, but it has an important problem. You cannot change the language by default. I have my iPad in Catalan/Spanish but I like to read in English. The app just gives you the default language of your device instead of having the option to decide which language you want to read the content. I've seen you can uninstall the app, change the default language of your device and install the app and then it works. But this is not a serious solution for a serious app. 
Another feature, not that important but it would very useful, it's that when you are in the reading screen. The reading screen doesn't rotate even you have your device on horizontal position. This would be great and useful for iPhone and iPad. Thank you."
Siempre encuentro cosas muy interesantes e inspiradoras.
Ayuda a conocer t√≠tulos interesantes de lectura. Aplicaci√≥n muy recomendable.
Es una buena aplicaci√≥n que tiene muy buen contenido y que puedes optar por escuchar el resumen de los libros para los que de forma auditiva capten mejor informaci√≥n! Solo sugerencia si hicieran ofertas de un mejor de precio de suscripci√≥n anual estar√≠a genial
Tienen muchos libros √∫tiles.
Tiene libros muy buenos son f√°ciles de leer y escuchar
Muy buena opci√≥n para escuchar libros interesantes mientras haces alguna actividad diaria que te permita escuchar atentamente! Me gusta üëçüèº
Fun
Ok
Muy bien logrados los res√∫menes, y la APP es bastante pr√°ctica!
Muy practico e interesante. Ofrece muy buenos consejos. Me ha gustado mucho por todo lo que he aprendido.
Creo que al pagar la suscripci√≥n anual deber√≠amos tener unas locuciones de los libros de calidad. No una voz rob√≥tica que no sabe interpretar los acentos. No os costar√≠a nada contratar a uno o dos locutores para subir la calidad de vuestra app.
Las voces son malisimas. Es como escuchar un robot. Sin alma. Tantos buenos libros y no os aplicais el cuento.
Adquieres conocimiento de una manera m√°s simple en cualquier momento del d√≠a que elijas para ello, aporta a tu crecimiento emocional e intelectual
Es una app fant√°stica para mejorar la vida de uno mismo
I love this app, I Just miss the opportunity to get to use landscape mode in order to use it alternatively with a notes app
"Estar√≠a muy bien poder usar la app en modo avi√≥n. 
(Se puede usar en modo avi√≥n, es perfecta) 

Edit*"
Cambi√≥ mi vida ü•≥
This app didn‚Äôt notify me for next month subscription and they took money from my bank account. Also, the app won‚Äôt help you. It is better to read the actual book. I demand for a refund for this month (december)
¬°Es una de las mejores Apps que tengo en el iPad y tel√©fono! Te ayuda a ser mejor y no a perder el tiempo. Lo que a√±adir√≠a valor es hacer unos res√∫menes algo mas detallados con alg√∫n cap√≠tulo m√°s y m√°s libros especializados.
Me encanta el enfoque de esta aplicaci√≥n ya que hay muchos libros de mejora personal se pueden sintetizar much√≠simo.
En verdad, me gusta mucho la App es muy √∫til para los aficionados a la lectura
Sigan incluyendo cada vez m√°s res√∫menes en espa√±ol.
Ayuda a conocer el contenido de cada libro y despu√©s siempre puedes comprarlo
Recommended!
Recibir lo realmente importante de buenos libros me facilita comprender lo realmente importante de la vida, y si alguno de estos res√∫menes me resulta impresionante, siempre tengo la opci√≥n de adquirir el libro completo en una librer√≠a. La App es muy Intuitiva y f√°cil de usar. Los textos son claros y directos. La lectura se hace muy amena.
El contenido mostrado seg√∫n mis intereses, es exactamente lo que estaba buscando.
"Muy buena aplicaci√≥n, para emplear  poco tiempo de tu d√≠a en como progresar, con grandes ense√±anzas que te har√°n cambiar tu visi√≥n y querer leer mas.
S√∫per sencillo de introducir en tu d√≠a a d√≠a"
Llevo 7 d√≠as con esta aplicaci√≥n y me esta pareciendo alucinante. Est√° compuesta por peque√±os libros de motivaci√≥n y progreso que toda clase de temas. Se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo. Me esta cambiando la perspectiva de ver muchas cosas.
Si tienes poco tiempo y quieres aprender, esta app va muy bien.
Recien he comenzado a utilizarla y tras leer unos cuantos libros puedo decir que por el precio que pagas aporta muchisimo valor. Recomendable 100%.
I already purchased the yearly plan 2 months ago and I can‚Äôt listen if I don‚Äôt pay again‚Ä¶
Tengo que decir que la lectura de los libros puede ser correcta, el audio de los libros debe ser muy mejorable. Parece le√≠do por un robot mostrando poco sentimiento en la lectura, al menos en los libros que he elegido. Estoy en el periodo de prueba, pero si no veo mejor√≠a en el audio en otros libros, no renuevo.
Tenlo en cuenta porque no puedes retroceder la compra, me siento estafado.
Muy buenos res√∫menes y realmente √∫til. Lo √∫nico que me resulta un poco inc√≥modo es que a veces aparecen libros en ingl√©s que no se cambian a tu idioma. Yo se Ingles pero en alg√∫n tipo de lectura para comprender en profundidad no es demasiado √∫til o no lo asimilas igual. Esto √∫ltimo deber√≠an tenerlo en cuanta. A√∫n as√≠ es muy muy recomendable
Calza exactamente con mi vida cotidiana, lo recomiendo
Para quien est√© en ese camino de construirse a s√≠ mismo esta aplicaci√≥n es un buen primer paso
No estaba segura de si me gustar√≠a, pero la verdad es que est√° muy bien. Descubres libros, algunos de ellos con el resumen tienes suficiente y con otros te despiertan tal interes que quieres comprarlos. Lo que s√≠ debe mejorar es la voz en espa√±ol, en ingl√©s est√° bien se entiende y lodula, pero en espa√±ol te est√° hablando una m√°quina, no ayuda a meterse en la lectura/escucha.
Lo he dejado al tercer libro propuesto, una retah√≠la de historias sobre alcalinidad, detox y que incluso daba el consejo de beber agua destilada, lo que no solo es poco recomendable sino hasta nocivo. No tengo tiempo para las pseudociencias en mi vida, por 10‚Ç¨ al mes me esperaba m√°s rigor en los libros elegidos.
"No es √∫til  la app , hay muy poco en Castellano. Y para cuando te das cuenta de esto, ya es tarde porque ya has pagado.  Es un enga√±o. Me dicen que intentan ampliar los libros en Castellano, pero veo opiniones de hace un a√±o que se quejaban de lo mismo.  
Arrepentida  de tirar el dinero."
Buena la verdad tiene cosas interesantes y ideas buenas
Los libros son muy buenos y lo mejor es que son muy cortos y muy entendedores.
ESTAFA! Sin darme cuenta descargue esta app y me cargaron un a√±o completo tras un supuesto periodo de prueba gratuito.
Hay dos o tres libros que puedes escuchar/leer sin pagar. A partir de ah√≠ o pagas o no puedes seguir leyendo libros
"Nunca encontraba tiempo para leer y tambien por falta de concentraci√≥n no me animaba a hacerlo. Headway me ha dado la oporrunidad de leer escuchando y es mas facil concentrarme en alguien que me esta hablando por lo que ha sido gratificante haber decidido escuchar siguiendo la pauta de
Lo que realmente me interesaa."
"Esta aplicaci√≥n no respeta el periodo de prueba, te cobra aunque canceles. Aplica el cobro de manera enga√±osa no te cobra como suscripci√≥n te cobra como pago. 
He reclamado escribir√© otra rese√±a si consigo que me devuelvan el dinero."
No podes hacer nada gratis, solo durante 7 d√≠as.
Esta app te ayuda a Enfocarte unos minutos en ti‚Ä¶.
"Good app over all but it‚Äôs confusing regarding payments. Way too easy to accidentally subscribe to extra stuff you don‚Äôt need. I thought I had paid $14,99 but turned out it was actually $40.

Edit: tried the app for a few days now and it is actually better than expected. Really useful and interesting content so worth the money after all."
Trying out their 7 days free trial for now and 2 days in, I‚Äôve enjoyed listening to many books I wanted to read. I do understand that they are only highlighting the main points but with a busy schedule these days, this is the best I can do for now.
Super convenient and helpful. The app helps me grow so much personally
"This app is a scam. They charge you on screen when you believe you are just signing up for a free trial to check if it is a good one for you. 

They take your money and tells you their policy does not allow for a refund yet does not display that you at the point of debiting your account. You want to cancel and request from Apply but you are unable to do so because the app is not independent of itself. It hides behind iTunes or I music so you are unable to select it to request for a refund. 

Scammers. Please do not download"
Great books summarized into digestible chunks. I love it!
It‚Äôs realistic and it was just like me talking to myself The Whole time. It was worth the read
Helpful
Headway! A great investment to jumpstart living one‚Äôs best life yet!
"I Have already purchased the 1 year subscription but you still bug me with ‚Äú a gift for you‚Äù option in order to purchase it. 
If you don‚Äôt fix it, I will request a refund."
I subscribed because I wanted to try the free trial period however before the end free 6 day period they charged my card with the full amount. That‚Äôs a very dark pattern to get peoples money!
This app relaxes me at nights and inspires me throughout the day
You learn so much from these books, and it is so easier with this app because it takes less time to read them
ŒßœÅŒÆœÉŒπŒºŒ∑ ŒµœÜŒ±œÅŒºŒøŒ≥ŒÆ Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÜŒøœÅŒµœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ ŒµŒΩŒ¥ŒπŒ±œÜŒ≠œÅŒøŒΩ ŒøœÄœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ
It gets to summarise the main points of a book making it easier to grasp the jest of them. Completing a summary gives you also a sense of achievement!
The acoustic part of the app is average at best. There are 3 voices at random and they are all robotic. You can get used to it but for this much $$ it‚Äôs not really worth it.
I canseled my subscription to this app and after a couple of days he took me 95,95 euros please report this
The app is for the cock. It asks so many things and after asks money ! And it‚Äôs expensive. And it‚Äôs not at all as they say. No drawings, nothing different. Just one sity audiobook app. Don‚Äôt download!
I like reading books, but my schedule is very tight, so, when I saw Headway I said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs give a try‚Äù‚Ä¶. I was almost sure that this free try will end without interest. Firstly I started to read books that I had already read as originals in order to check the quality and I was very pleasantly surprised. Now I have stopped buying or reading books elsewhere. Sometimes, when I have a flash about a book I check if Headway has it and I always find what I search !!! Amazing app!!!
Great selection of books and through summary‚Äôs
Toda la info clara y resumida, eso lo valor√≥ y aprecio demasiado.
Es mejor alimentar nuestra mente de cosas positivas, que ayudan a nuestro crecimiento f√≠sico y mental.
La app es sencilla de utilizar, tiene muy buen contenido. Los audiolibros son muy eficientes para pasar el tr√°fico.
Excelente aplicaci√≥n
Cu√°nto m√°s cuidados tengamos m√°s larga vida y sana obtendremos
La verdad utilizas el tiempo en el celular productivamente, aprendiendo, y no chismoseando.
Me permite escuchar y tambi√©n leer el resumen de los libros, me da lo m√°s importante.
Estoy encantada con la aplicaci√≥n, valioso el contenido de cada resumen de los libros, gracias
Nada
Me encanta, no le doy 5 porque creo que a√∫n faltan libros, pero espero ampl√≠en su librer√≠a
great way to learn and good content
"Me encantan los audio libros que he escuchado 
Me han servido como gu√≠a para una vida mejor"
Contenido al gusto y necesidad del interesado. Libros peque√±os acompa√±ados del audio libro que ayudan a mejorar la velocidad y comprensi√≥n de lectura.
Personalmente no leo libros de autoayuda, ni en aparatos digitales.  Me inclino m√°s por el libro convencional y la novela hist√≥rica pero decid√≠ darle un chance a este app por un libro en particular que me llamo la atenci√≥n.  Ya llevo 3 res√∫menes hoy, ¬°me encant√≥ todo el contenido!
Compromiso
Muy buenos res√∫menes
FYI
Fhjj
Fgjj
So inspiring the books are so good
I read them all and found most of them suit me
The content is good but the UX is hell, I can‚Äôt listen to it all the time; it either takes long time to load or didn‚Äôt load at all, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm paying for.
Don‚Äôt fall for this scam, you can never get your test result without paying an annual fee. Also, this app automatically posts a positive review on the app store after you have installed it. After I had found this out, I came back to leave this negative review.
Clear summaries + a feature for spaced repetition makes the app very useful. Worthy of 10 Stars üòÑ
I found it difficult to follow when I listen and read the text, I just lost my focus sometimes and I can‚Äôt find where I am, I suggest there can be a feature that highlighted the word along the audio play, in this way, I don‚Äôt need to scroll down the screen by myself.
Lots of books to choose from. Easy to read summaries.
"Warning: don't waste your time!
This app is Scam, books are useless trash"
Good
You have to blind payment once you try but it doesn‚Äôt ask if you agree to autopsy after free trial nor let you choose if you want to pay after trial
Headway has done a great job in summarising contents of different books. As people living in the modern world, we hardly have any time to read an entire book and by reading only the summary, we can get the gist of the book and gain more in less time.
Used Blinkist, Audible and liked Headway best
Awesome
Es un excelente recurso para fomentar la lectura y el aprendizaje.
Estoy retomando el h√°bito de la lectura..  Por mucho tiempo le√≠ libros pero por una extra√±a raz√≥n de dej√© hacerlo y cuando comenzaba un libro no pod√≠a terminarlo, creo que Headway es una gran ayuda para retomar la lectura, gracias a los res√∫menes.
La calidad de los res√∫menes  es incre√≠ble, siento que la condensaci√≥n de los libros te dejan muy claro el contenido del mismo.
Excelente, resume y motiva a Leer por completo el libro, pero cada resumen es igual de bueno que todo el contenido entero.
Full recomendado !
F√°cil de usar y buen contenido.
S√∫per recomendado
Le encant√≥ este resumen ya que enfocarlo m√°s b√°sico acerca de este libro nos ense√±a c√≥mo vivir de una mejor manera y nos ense√±an las cosas importantes por las que debemos vivir y encontrarle sentido a nuestra vida
"Realmente son libros tremendamente edificantes y que mejor si los leemos ya resumidos
Feliz con esta app"
Jako jednostavno i korisno provedeno vrijeme
Its a nice way to learn and read books on a daily basis and motivates you, however it is expensive and has not so much to offer when you dont pay
"Take care dear users. My app was chargeing me premium account withouth asking for it.

Apple was kind to reimburse me thanks Apple.

Unfortunatelly app user service is not helpfull and than how they are communicating with users is really critical!

I am deeply dissapointed!"
I read every day 10-15 minutes and it‚Äôs a game changer. Everyone has 15 minutes of the day and it gives so much value. A bunch of topics, everyone can find the best fit easily. I started to use this app so that when i like a book on the app i can go to the local library and get it. This way i spare myself time because i‚Äôll probably like the booküòÖ
I was signing up for snippets and afterwards you are offered some infographics and a workbook which you may think is part of the basic offer. In fact, they are not and a UI is designed in a way that you do not see that these are services that need to be paid for. I asked for a refund which they declined referring to the T&Cs. I recommend Blinkist. With them I never had any unpleasant experiences.
With no way to make a refund
I always read and listen one or two books everyday. They are really nice and easy to understand. The app is also really user friendly and good accessibility. Thank you
I find myself very inspired and encouraged with this app. A very good one!
The summary is short, precise, informative! Love it! I love books! I buy them.. but i never finish reading them. Mostly because i have no time and get bored halfway. This app is so helpful for someone like me. Love it!
Simple and Easy to read with wondefull insight
You can‚Äôt use this app landscape on iPad
Actually, I using this app to improve my listening skill for IELTS test and I realise that this app is very useful and get more benefit to increase my knowledge in listening. Thank for the developers, you guys are doing great!
Great book review App üëçüèº
This app will help you to gain knowledge in a short time. They provide interesting insights from every book
Thank God that I found Headway. I have trouble in finish a book due to my hectic schedules and Headway is the top-tier solution! It's worth for the priceü§ç Keep up the good work, Headway teamüëå‚ú®
THIS APP CHARGES YOU FULL YEAR PLAN FOR 7 DAYS FREE TRIAL! What a mess!
I mean instead of the dull & boring summary app, headway opt for different approach. They got them UI / UX right, a snippet from many book available out there. Would recommend it to everyone who are into book summary app.
Having headway as my Study tool for learning English  and improve my skills through reading are a Fortune for me.  Why? Because, through headway i can read to a key point of the Book without having much Time instead of read fuli Book, by having headway app it was a costless alto, an From the headway itself White reading each Book we can highlight and Evan Cherokee the transalate directly. Thaankyou so much for providing this Vera usefull app‚ò∫Ô∏èü•∞üòçü§©ü•≥
Never know reading is a fun task for a strict non-reader like me! Good job headway
Aplikasi ini ga jelas, tiba2 bisa auto subscribe tanpa pemberitahuan dengan harga 1.257 juta rupiah. Ga make sense banget. Padahal udh di uninstall sebelumnya sekalinya dikirimin email ada pemberitahuan renewal subscription tuh gimanaa woy !!!! Asli bikin kesel banget
"Aplikasi terbaik dan super duper worth, komplit juga~ 

Cuco"
I like reading self-help books. However, I don't have much time to read and I also don't have space for my books. This app keeps me reading easily, in a short time everyday!
Really help me to gain insights from a lot of book, without spend a lot of cost/time purchase and reading it thoroughly. Thanks Headway!
The title says it all. And what‚Äôs more that the price is reasonable.
Love this apps, i enjoy to reading and listening, and happy to see my self can beat the challenge. Yes it‚Äôs worth the price
Im a subscriber, I read using 11 ipad mostly, love the app, but the app does not offer landscape orientation, plese bring ibooks or play books landscape to this app
Summarizes without losing its soul
"this app help me to save time and gain more focus when reading (the audio summary really helped me focusing my attention when reading the text - in line with the audio).

overall; great experience and looking forward to subscribing for yearly plan when i‚Äôve saved some money for it!"
Thoroughly enjoying the app, I digest a book each morning before work.  Some books I have later gone on to purchase as a result of reading the condensed version.
".. this app managed to convince me to pay for a year subscription! I usually never give in to that!

Instead of me wondering how I can improve my life, then looking up various forums of blog posts to correct the issue, this app assesses your personality type then caters books to help you improve on certain areas of your life. 

The only thing I‚Äôd have to complain about is how it sometimes caters some books to me about a women‚Äôs body or how to please them. If that‚Äôs your cup of tea, then fair enough but I‚Äôm gay."
Excellent app
"I'm super happy that I decided to use headway everyday, I'm learning very quickly about lots of new topics. The self analysis features are very interesting.
Thanks to the whole team for developing this app and the summaries on it and everything else that was needed to put it all on my phone!"
Highly recommended
Very helpful to see if you‚Äôd like to read in more detail before ordering the book.
Me encanta leer y pasar el tiempo aprendiendo de todos los libros y mentes de los que los escribieron mucha informaci√≥n I love this ü§ó
Very good
Do not pay anything to them! No refunds for cancelled subscription! In app additional paid purchase hidden within set up steps! SCAM be aware
"I appreciate the insights given. I still see opportunity to evaluate my own experiences in my life and the relations of each book - Writing notes on the notes given. 

A really cool app, I‚Äôd love to see more insights or flash card options, relating to more of each story again, as I am pretty hungry for information as it isüòä"
This is exactly what I needed liam1234567h89
I am so happy with the app. I love my daily reading. Takes me just 20mins and I learn so much. The best decision I made.
I‚Äôm not quite sure how I found this app but already, after only a week of listening I‚Äôm hooked. I get the book I want in 15mins
A lot of troubles getting audio to play smoothly very slow and sometimes doesn't even play.
Me encanta
Brilliant app for time poor working Mum with young kids!
"It just wonderful 
Great way to learn and read
Make a good mindset 
Thanks"
Loved the app. Very concise overviews. Gives you enough to either to put a book into your mind ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù or to give you a nudge to read the full version. Thank you. Great app
Love it!
This is a very useful app, I am not into reading books at all but the way it‚Äôs simplified and summarised with Headway makes it completely different. I will keep up with Headway and eventually move onto books as well.
Brillant
It‚Äôs waste of money and time. Almost any feature from the add is not working or existing
"I would like to see if there is any option to add send to kindle like in Blinkist the short stories.
And I would like to see the full version of iPad and web too anyway, your app good"
This app was very persistent to get me on board as a payed member (kudos to your marketing team). And I enjoy it very much. Very informative summaries and other interesting and fresh features allows to get a quick overview of what a book is about. This way I filter out which books are great to purchase in the original and which are enough to read as a digest.
Deep dive in simple, easy to read  knowledge

You must move to human narration
I believe this app helps you get the main points of the books that you don‚Äôt have time to read fully. Well summarized and straight to the point. Five stars
It‚Äôs more effective and easy to use the app
Second day of using, three and a half books already..
Very helpful if you not into reading books or you don‚Äôt have time for reading a book.
As a UX researcher and designer I‚Äôm amazed of the user experience here! So easy and friendly. The idea of reading summaries is so suitable for these days! Would recommend everybody.
Nice application, i liked it alot
Great app! Straight to the point in evert single book, definitely worth it to me.
I have been on this app for about 30 minutes and I have already listened to two amazing summaries of books that have really helped shift my mindset. I am only on the 7 day trial right now but I am pretty sure I will purchase the yearly package when it‚Äôs over.
Just perfect
nicely organized, good books
Perfect
Great audio books!ü´∂üèª
Amazing app, inspiring and motivating you to take real actions in your life!!
Very useful
"The app is set up in a really fun, friendly & easy way.
It has the best books, I‚Äôm able to get all the information & knowledge from the books in a really easy & fun way that suits my schedule.
This app makes me feel really good & proud of myselfüòä Thank you!"
This is a great app to make a huge impact on your life!! Truly a game changer :)
I am not an avid reader, but after subscribing to Headway, it really has trained my brain to read more of the books. And having important aspects highlighted in the books and conclusions, helps a lot as well. Thanks a lot for this!
It absolutely works if you work on it absolutely üíØ
Don't waste your time downloading it until and unless you wanna spend money. Everything is paid in the app.
Good
"They showed ‚Äò3 days free trial then ‚Çπ649/month‚Äô
When I click , Apple subscription popup says ‚Äò3 days free trial then 649/week‚Äô
saying 649/month then charging that per week is shotty behavior. I cannot believe Apple is allowing this crap on their platform. This app should be banned."
"The summaries of books are very shallow and doesn‚Äôt even touch the essence. It appears s if these people have asked high school students to summarise the chapters. 

Not at all worth the money they charge. 

Not recommended."
"The app says 3 days free trial and then Rs 649 per month. 

But on payment page it says Rs 649 per week.

It‚Äôs an open fraud."
A comfortable way to grow.
Better than any app I have tried till date. Nice interface, amazing insights and good collection of books. The book suggestion feature is very helpful as well. Better spend here than Netflix.
Headway has helped me consolidate crucial points from a book that I‚Äôd rather save time on than to use my time reading through unnecessary information that may not be of any relevance to me. If I do want to learn more it mentions the chapter number and thereby exactly guiding me to the place where it might‚Äôve consolidated the information from. (That‚Äôs if you‚Äôve bought the book.) I‚Äôve had a good time reading away through information and It has especially helped me learn more in less time. :)
Best App. But the story quotes seems to not be refreshing. Please fix that. On the home page
I like the summary part, very well!! As I m getting busier these days, these summaries are very help to fulfill my reading needs and easily fit in with my schedule.. as they only take 10-15 minute of time.. I read them as short breaks or in travelling or waiting times .. I found it productive
An awasome app. Must have for book lovers and even  those who love to learn and explore this world, as there is so much to know from books.
Waste
"I love reading and learning from books. But from sometime, I was away from reading. Headway brought my lost love of reading back onto my life. Most books today are not so dense at would be a classic like ‚ÄúThe Prince‚Äù so reading them as a short summation of main points is not only efficient but also helpful as it‚Äôs easier to remember the messages in the book.
I bought it‚Äôs premium plan on discount and it is proving to be the best investment I have made in a long time.
I wish I had found it sooner."
This will help you How to do? When you loss your track it will help you get back on track.
Excellent concept and execution!
They do not send upcoming renewal reminder. When they renew for next year. And if you ask for refund because you not gonna use app for whole next year. They won‚Äôt refund. In short they want to charge you even if you don‚Äôt want to use their service. They don‚Äôt have confidence on their product quality so they don‚Äôt send you upcoming payment renewal reminder. And do not refund you wven if you are not using their app. Unethical practice! Fraudulent!
INR 7000 gone. Bogus subscription plans. Apple should take this app down.
Still a good source for daily free reads and short stories
you charge me 6900 without taking my permission. i want my money back and want to cancel this subscription. looters. and after stealing money this app is not working..
Saves a lot of time and ensures that your job of self development is done
The subscription cost is high, but worth it if you are keen leaner and actually wants to build habit of reading and learning new skills..I would have given 10 out 5 üòÖif it would get low in subscription.
Really cool app, easy to use and user friendly üòç
This app charged me 6900 for one subscription, i did not even select 6900 option but they straightaway charged plus when i pressed on usubscribe it charged me 9900. I want refund, please refund my money. I dont want any access to your app, refund my money.
Deducted entire year subscription on adv click & app update & on complaining it I got another fooling link for refund which ends up with no help
Positive
life changing !!
"Literally Saved me weeks of reading books, the summary of each book is pretty good though they can increase the length of summary a bit more.
Otherwise a must app for everyone who loves gaining right knowledge."
No such Interesting books..!!!
Very limited collected.
Great app to read over summaries of many books
Already read so many bad reviews so not buying it. If they are taking money by fraud, not touching this.
Waste of time
Helpful in growing in a positive way
Excellent
Nice, very convenient, easy explanation, sum voices are robust but overall good experience
Theyll quickly cleverly sign you up without clarity on pricing and then deduct amount and never refund you. Customer service will take loterally months to reply. Scammers and looters lowlifes
The app offers a free trail for a ‚Äúone year plan‚Äù. Cheap marketing trick! The selection of books and summaries are sub-par! There are way better apps out there!
Get it stop thinking just get it
Hi headway the app is amazing i am a premium user and have been using it from months . One suggestion that you guys can add rating option for the books. The ratings can be given by the readers who completed the book and the ratings will be visible to everyone.
"I have been using it since almost two months, you can enhance your knowledge by just spending 15 minutes a day on an average. 

Go for it."
Directly stealing money is one thing, having less options in books is another. The narrator making silly mistakes while pronouncing the words is yet another mistake. Fraud app.
Just started using this and love it already!
Not even close to what the ad depicts, you can‚Äôt read or listen unless you subscribe, and I‚Äôm still skeptical on the extent to which the app is able to convey the message of certain books!
That DELETE ACCOUNT tab ain‚Äôt working. Every time I select that option I get redirected to get started.
Easy to understand, save time and convenient
I really love this app
I think Headway has the best summary among its competitors
Apple PencilÎ°ú ÌïòÏù¥ÎùºÏù¥Ìä∏, ÌïÑÍ∏∞, Î©îÎ™® Îì±Ïùò ÌôúÏö©Ïù¥ Í∞ÄÎä•ÌïòÎ©¥ Ï¢ãÍ≤†ÏäµÎãàÎã§.
An app that really seems to help you in what you need. Recommend this
The app is closed/crashed whenever I turn other app and then come back. This is really annoying. Other than that, I'm satisfied with the service
I can get a free daily reading which is short so that it dont take much time and also inspiring. It's good to be able to check the vocab that I don't know immediately, and the app save them automatically in one place. I can check the whole vocab at a glance after finishing a book.
It is a very good app, but even though I‚Äôm a premium subscriber, i am still getting popup to buy headway again. Please request your tech team to look into it.
i can workout or cook and read Book without actually reading and takes less time üòç
We need Colleen hover books! Love the app
Honestly, Headway is one of the most amazing, important, & joyful applications, that helps to develop the personal skills & performance
The very first day after download the App charged me 3 times in total around 40$. They sent me email with the link with my personal plan, as promised during test. And it was nowhere said that it is for separate payment, not a word, no price tag . When I wrote to support team, they said there was a link and by downloading it I agreed to purchase ‚Äúthe product‚Äù they offered. I‚Äôve sent screenshots where there‚Äôs no word about payment and now they don‚Äôt reply at all. Then what is the subscription payment for? And what for is the third payment? Looks like phishing links and fraud. Totally disappointed.
"Even after I cancelled all subscriptions its trying to steal my money everyday I had to block my card I have no subscriptions but they trying to get money 9.99$ insufficient? Trying 6.99$. Apple where are you looking for? by the way, instead of free trial they got my 6.99$ at the very begining and didnt refund

Upd: as I received reply I can send you or apple or anyone all the proofs! Your app is fraud or broken! Should be delisted"
If you absorb information better when you listen, go for it
I recommend this!
Motivating and good ui ux
Very helpful
"Dont event try to hesitate -
It‚Äôs perfect and you need it"
Fantastic app, but I am not sure who writes the texts AI or human. Some ideas from the books are not easy to compress into a few sentences. And should you do this if such text lacks context and is not captivating? For me is better to have a longer read than seemingly short but confusing. "Repetition" doesn't work. I tried restarting iPhone and deleting the app. But the app still doesn't allow me to repeat my 74 cards. Overall the app is easy to use on every day basis. Oh, and design is on a God level! Thank you!
I‚Äòve never been a reading person, but since I discovered Headway, I aim to read 1 book per day. It‚Äòs practical that you can read the summery of so many books and discover new ways of thinking. I like it a lot. 5üåü
Excellent content and very nice conclusions and details to avoid reading the ‚Äúbig books‚Äù
Prices notice should be given before asking a million of questions.
If you are person who don‚Äôt have the time to read or are simply to lazy, this app is a perfect fit for you.
Great app that provide the motivation to learn by reading and hearing. Thank you.
Amazingly good! Loved the summaries and especially the free books each day!!
Puedes leer muchos res√∫menes de libros en COO tiempo y si alguno te gusta mucho comprar el libro completo.
Se ve buena la app, pero me dec√≠a 3 d√≠as o semanas o meses gratis (la verdad no me acuerdo) pero me jalo el dinero a√∫n as√≠ ahora ya no puedo recuperarlo :/ pague por algo que no estoy utilizando a parte no me sirve Todos los libros que vi estaban en ingl√©s
It helps me see which books I‚Äôd like to spend my money and time on.
Excelente breves y concisos
This app is a great tool for people who want to be informed and prepared.
Me a encantado hasta ahora los res√∫menes de los libros son muy expl√≠citos, y cuentan los mejor de cada libro aunque me gustar√≠a que hubiera muchos m√°s temas como ciencia, tecnolog√≠a, historia, fantas√≠a etc.
Me encanta la aplicaci√≥n, toda la informaci√≥n que necesito en un resumen. Todos los d√≠as estoy al pendiente de lo que voy a leer. Con gran variedad de libros incre√≠bles.
Buenisima para estar haciendo otras actividades mientras se escucha el audiolibro.
"Esta aplicaci√≥n es muy amiga le y resume los
Libros muy concretos"
Gracias por esta herramienta que me es √∫til para mi autodesarrollo !!!!
Fully loaded with knowledge and information!
Esta aplicaci√≥n pone al alcance la lectura sin importar que tan ocupada est√©s! Te das una gran idea del contenido de un libro por si quieres continuar y de manera resumida te ofrece excelentes lecturas !
La mayor√≠a de los libros son ingl√©s, pongan m√°s en espa√±olü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
Please come get me, I really want to help on becoming an interstellar race :P
Resume perfectamente los cap√≠tulos y te ayuda a entender cada una de las ideas principales.
Descargue la prueba gratis de 7 dias y autom√°ticamente se carg√≥ por 1 a√±o sin posibilidad de cancelar y si. Autorizaci√≥n. Solicito mi reembolso es un ROBO no la descarguen
Al elegir escuchar la rese√±a los saltos de velocidad son muy grandes. De 1x salta a 1.25x, deber√≠an dar a elegir una velocidad intermedia como 1.1 o 1.2x ya que 1.25 resulta demasiado r√°pido.
Me encanta
Nada es gratis mmm
I read a lot‚Ä¶.. it is never enough for me. So an app that helps me extract main ideas from books, allows me to decide if the book is worth buying‚Ä¶. It is very good to fill your unproductive time with mini-audiobooks‚Ä¶. Thanks
Me encant√≥ :)
Hace algunos d√≠as descargu√© la prueba gratuita, cuando hoy me di cuenta que ayer me aplicaron la suscripci√≥n de todo el a√±o por $1,699 sin preguntarme qu√© opci√≥n quer√≠a, fue un completo robo, exijo mi reembolso. Tengan cuidado, no descarguen la aplicaci√≥n, terminar√°n rob√°ndoles
"Straight to the main idea! 
Try it!"
"Buen contenido multidisciplinario; facilidad para leer o escuchar as√≠ se adapta a tu estilo de vida.
Solo la parte de escuchar me parece que podr√≠a mejorar en la entonaci√≥n que se le da q la lectura."
Para aprender cosas nuevas de una manera sencilla y practica. Lo mas importante y se puede Leer o escuchar. Aprender mientras se manejo el auto me ha cambiado la manera de viajar üëåüèΩ y permite guardar para consultar sina estar en l√≠nea muy recomendable, aunque  faltan mas t√≠tulos en espa√±ol.
Buen√≠simos res√∫menes y hay de todo
Me molesta cuando una App se vende como gratuita y te hacen perder tiempo en registro, preguntas y preferencias para al final decirte que es de cobro, y ofrecerte prueba gratis, sean honestos con su mercadotecnia.
La mejor app de redumenes, 100% recomendado.
"Explican de una manera sencilla y profesional , te abre el panorama y te anima a seguir con tus proyectos de vida 
Gracias Headway"
In my opinion is a excellent opportunity for increase my knowledge.
I love how Headyway explain a whole book in only 10-15 minutes! And also has different options to learn or ‚Äúread‚Äù a book like reading, listening and watching videos. Highly recommend
Buenos res√∫menes

Crecimiento
Me encanto y fue de gran utilidad
Te dan las ideas m√°s importantes, y la selecci√≥n de libros es muy buena
Es una aplicaci√≥n que te ayuda a digerir los libros m√°s r√°pido y adem√°s creo que con el tiempo se puede volver un gran h√°bito
Aunque sea de paga siempre tiene peque√±as opciones gratuitas. La idea de las historias con frases para recordar es fabulosa!!
Los res√∫menes son muy pr√°cticos y resulta muy f√°cil comprender las lecturas. Muy satisfecho con esta app.
La mejor manera de aprovechar mi tiempo libre la Encontr√© en esta aplicaci√≥n. ‚ÄúSomos lo que comemos y bebemos y somos lo que leemos‚Äù. ‚Ä¶ entre otras cosas‚Ä¶ üòäCon Headway ya no tengo excusas para decir hoy no tuve tiempo de leer algo nuevo, es la aplicaci√≥n ideal para seguir cultiv√°ndote en  esos 30 minutos que te quedan libre üòäüëåüèΩ
Love the adaptations
Si te gusta la lectura pero nunca encuentras un espacio para leer esta aplicaci√≥n te facilitar√° la vida y te permitir√° ver que libros son los que realmente te gustar√≠a leer.

.
Me encanta, tienes grandes libros y narrados de una manera simple y f√°cil de entender, que te ponen a meditar un poco. Y si los pones en pr√°ctica ser√°n un gran cambio de vida !
Love it. You gotta try it. Especially if you are like me who finds a ton of reasons to postpone a long read or has a hard time remembering the value of my last read.
Love the content is deep enough but short enough to advance at a good pace. Also price - benefit ratio is hard to beat
10/10
R√°pidamente estructuras ideas de temasnde t√∫ inter√©s o nuevos. Realmente lo disfruto.
De mal gusto no ponerle costo hasta que no te entregamos toda la informaci√≥n.
Tiene muchos libros interesantes y de acuerdo a tus intereses te ofrecen m√°s! Me ha gustado  mucho!
Si est√°s interesado en leer de otros temas ir no pertenezcan a tu rama pero no tienes tiempo, si quieres aprender nuevas cosas o reforzar √°reas de tu carrera o profesi√≥n pero no sabes c√≥mo hacerlo, esta es la app para ti. Al inicio te dan un margen de temas que te agradar√≠an aprender, en mi caso quiero fortalecer la administraci√≥n, las finanzas y el crecimiento personal y por ende seleccione eso. Al paso de los d√≠as me han dado una serie de libros con el objetivo de irlos leyendo 15 min al d√≠a y sinceramente estoy fascinado. 100% recomendable
Esta es una gran aplicaci√≥n si quieres aprender y progresar en tu vida. Tiene cientos de res√∫menes que ciertamente tienen los puntos m√°s importantes del libro que est√° resumiendo. Muy recomendada
Since last update the anual subscription is not working
Es una forma pr√°ctica y agradable de fomentar la lectura sobretodo cuando siempre tienes cosas que hacer y buscas esos peque√±os tiempos muertos para la sutomsuperacion y dejar de poner excusas, esta app es buen√≠sima. 100% recomendada.
Extraordinarios resumenes

Excelente App, lo que buscaba !

"Hasta hoy he le√≠do 2 res√∫menes y me han encantado porque han ido directo al grano y cuentan con una muy buena redacci√≥n que lo hace todo entendible 

Te ayuda tambi√©n bastante para tener el h√°bito de leer constantemente 
Es necesario que despu√©s de leer los res√∫menes tambi√©n se tenga un sistema para implementar lo aprendido"
Great app but missing CarPlay support so for that reason I‚Äôm giving it a four star rating for now.
"Hola, esta aplicaci√≥n esta maravillosa. Disfruto de sus res√∫menes y he encontrado tambi√©n muy valioso poder escuchar y leer al mismo tiempo.

Utiliz√≥ las diferentes velocidades de la aplicaci√≥n y desarroll√≥ mi lectura r√°pida y aprendo oyendo y leyendo. TODA UNA EXPERIENCIA!!!

Felicidades!!!!!  ALTAMENTE RECOMENDABLE"
La verdad no soy una persona que tenga el h√°bito de leer, descubr√≠ esta App y hoy tan solo llevo un d√≠a us√°ndola y WOW, ya me sent√≠ s√∫per motivada a seguir leyendo y leyendo, se me hace la mejor idea para personas que se les dificulta leer o no buscan el tiempo para hacerlo, los res√∫menes son muy concretos y motivadores. 100% recomendado, excelente idea de app, adem√°s es ayuda a guardar tus frases favoritas.

Love it
Muy buenos res√∫menes
"Es Justo lo que requiero para progresar, me ayuda a dejar la procrastinaci√≥n y enfocarme, ya hab√≠a intentado por muchos medios!
Adem√°s tiene un precio asequible !
Muchas gracias y bendiciones para sus creadores y los compa√±eros en curso!"
Que pasada, me cobraron la suscripci√≥n por un a√±o, luego vuelvo a entrar y no me dej√≥ abrir ning√∫n audiolibro, luego cierra sesi√≥n y me vuelve a pedir de nuevo que me suscriba y ya pagu√© el a√±o, es un robo
Muy √∫til para personas ocupadas, con gran variedad de t√≠tulos.
Me h ayudado a incrementar mis minutos de lectura diaria
Aprend√≠ mucho lo llevar√© a cabo
Me subscrib√≠ para la prueba de 7 d√≠as gratis y autom√°ticamente cobro de mi tarjeta $456 NO LA DESCARGUEN repito NO LA DESCARGUEN aparte que los libros no est√°n completos m√°s bien es como un resumen del libro üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª
"Me gusto o√≠rlo son sencillos y concisos lo explican y resumen bien.
Muchas gracias!"
No la descarguen dice un mes gratis y ahora no se como pero me quieren cobrar 1.699 pesos mexicanos casi 85 d√≥lares de mi tarjeta
En muy pocos minutos puedes reflexionar
Decepcionada. Indebidamente me han hecho el cobro dos veces el mismo d√≠a por la misma aplicaci√≥n y no han procedido a devoluci√≥n.
Nunca hab√≠a le√≠do un libro al d√≠a y con esta app se me echo muy practico
I have found a great fountain of good thinking  for my professional life!
Encuentras mucho contenido de calidad, m√°s su facilidad de escucharlo, hace de la app una gran fuente de informaci√≥n üëç
Ayuda mucho cuando quieres aprender y no tienes mucho tiempo
"Me encanto y Me atrapo 
S√∫per recomendada"
¬øLa lectura y/o utilizaci√≥n de la app es en espa√±ol?
Todos los libros esta en ingl√©s pero la app te la venden en espa√±ol! No sirve para quien no hablamos ingl√©s
Realmente es muy pr√°ctico, √∫til y se puede aprender mucho cada d√≠a
Es una buena idea esta aplicaci√≥n me ha ayudado bastante
"Sin duda, Headway es una App muy √∫til para alimentar tu mente con ideas frescas e informaci√≥n que te ayudar√° a desarrollar aquellas √°reas de oportunidad que necesitas pulir. 
Es breve, sencilla, √∫til y muy pr√°ctica, una App bastante buena."
Sol√≠a ser un chico distra√≠do con malos h√°bitos y hundido en mis pensamientos negativos. Descargue esta aplicaci√≥n por curiosidad y me ha encantado tiene libros muy buenos los cuales te dan una perspectiva muy positiva de las cosas y unos consejos excelentes qu√© te ayudan mucho en tu vida cotidiana. La recomiendo bastante üëçüèº
Es buena aplicaci√≥n para conocer una vista previa del contenido de un libro que te interesa
Es una aplicaci√≥n que ayuda much√≠simo a desarrollar o mejorar la habilitadas de leer y escuchar
Todo lo que buscaba üî•
Es buen concepto pero cay√≥ en las manos equivocadas. Si quieren pueden leer los libros gratis busc√°ndolos por pdf o hay otras plataformas menos costosas, justas y nada avariciosos como el equipo detr√°s de esta app. Es un rob√≥, no paguen ninguna suscripci√≥n porque te cobran el a√±o o te cargan varias suscripciones en un pago.
Me encanta escuchar me hace concentrarme en el tiempo libre aprovechar Esos tiempos en lectura  de aprendizaje
es una aplicaci√≥n sencilla que te ayuda a ponerte objetivos todos los d√≠as, informaci√≥n detallada y resumida, me encanta!
Cuesta, pero vale cada centavo.
F√°cil, conciso,r√°pido, me gustar√≠a leer tanto como antes pero a mis 41 a√±os con un trabajo demandante, una familia y lo que esto implica me parec√≠a imposible, hasta que encontr√© esta app, me ayudado a ampliar mi conocimiento sobre los temas de mi inter√©s y a relajarme durante el proceso a dejar las distracciones en las que perdia tiempo y no me dejaban nada, ahora empleo eso tiempo en mi crecimiento personal.
Excelentes res√∫menes y contenido
Tiene literatura muy √∫til y cada d√≠a aprendo m√°s, quiero seguir mejorando cada √°rea de mi vida
Les recomiendo pagar la suscripci√≥n! Es buenisima
Muy interesante lo recomiendo ampliament
Me funciona porque puedo escuchar mientras leo retengo mayor informaci√≥n
I really like the well written resumes. They sum up the most important points of the books very well
Decid√≠ bajar la App para poder aprender y captar ideas para mi mejor desarrollo personal y ha sido de gran ayuda. Mientras me arreglo o hago ciertas actividades escucho los res√∫menes e ideas m√°s importantes de los libros y han sido de gran ayuda
Es una app en la cual tienes a tu disposici√≥n intensidades cantidades de informaci√≥n muy valiosa extremadamente resumida de una manera muy eficaz, simplemente la mejor app para leer
Grandes consejos y tips en sus lecturas, con la lectura gratuita diaria es suficiente si no tienes mucho tiempo libre.
I paid to be a premium customer but in the app it shows as if I didn't pay.  I contacted customer service several times and they refuse to get back to me and give an answer.  Now I'm stuck after paying for the app but without any ability to use the app as I would like.
Es muy bueno, ma ha ayudado a leer mas
Muy buena app, totalmente recomendable, para personas que gustan superarse
"Voy empezando realmente y me gusta lo que eh escuchado, a veces es duro darse cuenta de las cosas que hacemos mal. 
Espero seguir creciendo mentalmente con la ayuda de Headway."
Muy claro el punto principal de lo que trata el libro.
La app me cobr√≥ la subscripcion anual sin haber accedido antes, no dejo que terminara los 7 d√≠as de prueba y me realiz√≥ el pago
Los libros que e encontrado todos me han ense√±ado algo.. ademas elijo esta aplicaci√≥n cada vez que tengo el celular y a mi me emociona nutrirme de conocimientos.
Me gusta la sencillez y practicidad
We all should read this book. We need it to find determination and strength to evolve üôè.
He aprendido mucho sobre varios temas abreviado directo al grano y sin gastar mucho dinerl en libros ahorrando muchi tiempo y con mas variedad de temas que nunca
Me ayuda a liberar y pensar de otra forma.
The apps language is the same as the phones. I‚Äôm trying to learn a new language so my phone is not on my native tongue. The app was locked to this language and I can‚Äôt change it. Please add an option to do so.
Recomiendan la biblioteca de Bill Gates. No, gracias.
Vale la pena pagar la suscripci√≥n, hay mucha variedad de libros. √önicamente estar√≠a bien mejorar en la interfaz al manejar el perfil del usuario, de ah√≠ en m√°s es muy buena app.
Headway knows me and chooses books that I need instead of me looking for what I like
"Cancele mi servicio y me lo cobraron. 
Necesito mi rembolso"
"When I use my iPad the app is not adjusting the horizontally and vertical depend the position I‚Äôm using my IPad. And the last one is that I can not highlight words.

For people that want to reach in a faster way to the point of any book this app is really good! I love it!"
I love the format of the app
Es una mala app solo te da lectura de las hipnosis de los libros y despu√©s te da la opci√≥n de comprarlos en Amazon‚Ä¶ adem√°s espero mi rembolso de los 7 d√≠as pero al parecer no aplica
Y muy buena las s√≠ntesis de libros. Es de f√°cil lectura y buen contenido
Muy buen contenido y practico!
No bajen esta app, hubiera le√≠do los comentarios antes, pues es cierto que es estafa. Baj√© la prueba gratuita y me cobraron sin preguntar los $1699 anual!!! no me hab√≠a dado cuenta hasta que tuve que checar en mi banco de donde hab√≠a salido ese dinero. Exigo mi reembolso. Y lo peor es que no puedes cancelar la suscripci√≥n hasta que pase un a√±o üò†üò†üò†üò°üò°üò°
La aplicaci√≥n compila la informaci√≥n m√°s relevante del contenido y lo muestra de una forma puntual, aunque podr√≠a tener m√°s ejemplos y oportunidad de apuntes.
Caro, pero tiene buenos res√∫menes de los libros y si encuentras uno que te llame la atenci√≥n puedes comprarlo para la lectura completa
Muy caro para lo que ofrecen, con lo que cobraron al a√±o podr√≠as comprarte muchos libros digitales y sacarles m√°s provecho, desde el principio deber√≠an decir cuanto cuesta la renta de su app y evitar la molestia de descargarla y luego sorprenderse con el precio
Una app que te ayuda enserio
La verdad tiene muchos libros muy interesantes y sobre todo informativos creo que me ah ayudado  a ver diferentes  ciertos h√°bitos que tenia en mi vida y afrontarlos con un enfoque diferente la recomiendo mucho
"Me gusta mucho la experiencia de usuario que permite la app, ya sea leer o reproducir en modo de audiolibro.
Excelente contenido."
Tienes res√∫menes de libros en 15 min y son muy buenos
BUENISIMA!!! comprenla vale cada peso!
You mean not everything is free after buying subscription and the first button you find thirty seconds after having payed for my subscription is for an extra fee?
"I started to used Headway recently, I‚Äôm trying the free trial and I love the application. Specially because you can study your highlights using flash cards. I love the design but actually I consider it‚Äôs very expensive. I‚Äôm considering to pay for the anual subscription but I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ 
If you like to read and you don‚Äôt have enough time to read a entirely book, it‚Äôs a good option. 
I love the summaries, and there are a lot of interesting books that I‚Äôd like to read entirely. 
You can make a test to know your kind of intelligence and the application recommends you some books related to your king of intelligence. In addition there are challenges where you can read different books about one topic, for example self improvement or something like that."
Me gusta por que aunque no debe ser considerada un sustituto a la lectura es bueno para momento como cuando manejas poder disfrutar el contenido
Muy buena app vale cada peso pagado
Son extraordinarios los t√≠tulos y los libros que puede encontrar aqu√≠ y disfrutar de ellos, seguir√© leyendo m√°s y m√°s, gracias.
Me encanta la aplicaci√≥n estoy aprendiendo cosas que ya sabia a un as√≠ sirve mucho para repaso o aprender algo que se te escap√≥ leyendo libros f√≠sicos pero realmente los libros est√°n buenos siento que falta un poco m√°s de variedad m√°s de libro por eso le pongo 4 estrellas
Tengan cuidado, te cobran sin utilizar la app, cancele el 28 de octubre y expidieron recibo nuevamente el 15 de nov y la membres√≠a premium, les recomiendo Storytel, esta no la descargar√≠a.
Me gusta tengo 2 dias de haberla comprado...pero de verdad URGE QUE PONGAN ACENTO LATINO en la lectura de sus libros. El espa√±ol catalan hace que uno nopueda concentrarce y termine perdiendo enfoque
"Esta es una App donde una voz robotizada lee un texto.
Literalmente puedes hacer lo mismo en word, ya que la voz que ‚Äúlee‚Äù no tiene entonaci√≥n, ni ritmo.
Disculpen pero tienen que invertirles en narradores.
Hay apps mejores con los mismos libros y muuuuy bien narrada, es storytel"
Te ofrecen libros que nunca tienen y si buscas alg√∫n t√≠tulo nada mas no lo encuentro. Y el idioma no es el de t√∫ pa√≠s. Por favor no la adquieran. Es un robo y a mi no me quieren regresar mi dinero
Easy and goes to the main idea!
I don't have much time to read, so app like this helped me gain that insights and knowledge from books, just by listening to it. üëçüèª
Highly recommended. Better than the competition.
Summaries which really focused on key points. Great tool to encourage reading habit.
I love this app as I struggle with time to finish a whole book.
It is impossible for me to read a book, however this app help me not only finishing a book and apply to daily lives. Well done and keep it up
I have nothing to say. I really enjoyed this appüòÖüëçüèª
This is the first time I‚Äôve encountered an app where you are immediately charged upon selecting the free trial which btw is the only button you can select with a note indicating that you will be charged for an annual subscription. It‚Äôs extremely misleading and deceiving. Take heed of the other reviews here cautioning on this as I failed to do so. If you Google you‚Äôll see countless others who have fallen trap to this cruel ploy. Apple should ban this app!
loveeeeee. I always listening when drive to work!
The format gives you the gist of what the book says and makes it easy to learn and reflext.
Easy app and helpful
With headway I‚Äôm about to cover and get insights from so many books it unreal lol
Came across this app on ig and decided to give it a try and all I can say for just 30 minutes of my first day is wow.
So much filled with summary that are worth reading
What an app it really helping me to read a book minimum per day which I‚Äôm so happy about .
"I love this app üíØüíØüíØ I don‚Äôt wanna ever live without it. It changes my life in ways that are unimaginable..  I love headway‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú® 
I bet it‚Äôs going to change your life too"
Really life changing
Very good App. Set up easy
I cannot get enough of the summaries, concise and straight to the point. Great app!
Been using for a week now and its a faster way to read
Why do we have to payü•≤
"I really like it helps breakdown books easily , it gives a motivation to start reading and following up no matter if you have control over you daily schedule or not . It‚Äôs like a grab and go 
Whether you are tired and want it read for you at night or listening in the car or whether you want to read and reread it is good .  This will also give you a more profound look at purchasing the book in request and know whether the extended reading is worthy of your time ."
It‚Äôs a beautiful app. Easy to use with a friendly interface. I love it
I love every bit of reading and listening here.
Great for reading and listening
I love this app! Perfect for me and my busy life!
So grateful to come across this app, my life is better now
Good
Highly recommended, helps to understand every aspect of the book with feature words and simples sentences.
Me gusta esta app. Porque es sencilla y sust√°ncial. Tiene una gran variedad de temas. Apenas estoy empezando y llevo ya dos libros que me han encantado.
"Estoy muy feliz porque acabo de iniciar y ya llevo dos libros , f√°cil de usar, entendible los audio libros y el mejor contenido ...
Amo esta aplicaci√≥n üëÜüèº"
Just love it, in this crazily fast world, it helps you to be updated with all the books you would like to read but you just don‚Äôt have enough time!
You cant do anything without payingüôÑ
I bought this so I could listen to the audio summaries. What a terrible voice!! I hate it so much I cannot listen to it.  What a waste of money.
Horrible customer service. I accidentally clicked on an infographic upsell they placed as the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button, where I ended up with a tripple charge of the subscription fee. No understanding from customer support agent. I‚Äôll leave this app for good!
Amazing app, love how it looks and works. Too bad you can‚Äôt pay monthly.
I keep getting adds for this app which is supposed to include tests to check which type you are, so you can improve those areas, only the tests are nowhere to be found. This is something that needs fixing!
Happy to read the essence of a lot of books on my down time.
Few bugs but it‚Äôs ok
I listen to the summaries whilst doing house chores.. feels super productive!‚ù§Ô∏è
"I‚Äôm not amused about the fact that I paid ‚Ç¨90,- while their are different prices in the contract overview. I‚Äôm paying ‚Ç¨70 too much as I can see there is a yearly Headway premium for ‚Ç¨22,- ?! 
Please explain and return money to those who actually were positive about you app."
Useless app ever.
"I made that teat 3 times and at the end something else appeared and i lose time w.f 
Not ok !"
"Betaald voor proef periode ik vond het niets en opgezegd in de proof periode
Maar geen geld terug gekregen !!!!
Scam!!!
Oplichters!!!!!"
"I really regret my subscription. The voices are super robotic sometimes. The ones I had during the trial were not nearly as robotic and annoying as with other books. 
I can‚Äôt stand the robotic voice and I wish I hadn‚Äôt purchased a subscription."
I was triggered through the 14 day refund - turns out it‚Äôs not so simple!!! Have to contact App Store support?!?!
I downloaded it for the intelligence type test and it doesn‚Äôt show the results without subscribing 50‚Ç¨ a month‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no free trial or anything. Disappointing.
"The narrators all sound like suicidal, super monotonous. The content is also quite mediocre, think i listened to 6 or 7 so books, everything they said is either common knowledge or bs about earning money
0.5 stars for headway

Byebye"
I have a iPad Pro and when you start the app it can only display portrait mode, this is really a strange thing as a lot of us read on an iPad, especially the Pro in landscape mode with a keyboard but also on the iPhone or standard iPad. How difficult can this be to implement(not) and why would you not even take care of this. I think this is a paramount standard that is readily available in the apple toolkit and as such find this absolutely mind boggling why it is not in!
Waves time and helps!
Is an excellent app for reading and learning every day capsules of good information
A great way to receive input on topics that are interesting - selected by  yourself - in a summary that you can either read or listen to, save for revisit if it was really interesting and decide if you want the complete book or not. For people interested in information and lack of time (or like me easy to be distracted)
Great app. Straight to the point:)
"You shouldn‚Äôt use this app as a quick way to read best-sellers. You should use this app to figure out what subjects you want to dive deeper in and which books you want to read in it‚Äôs entirety. 

Yes. Their subscription prices take advantages of their customers, but you shouldn‚Äôt complain about the pricing if you are not even ready to pay for your knowledge or self-growth. Either 23‚Ç¨ or 90‚Ç¨ per year should be worth it if you take self-growth seriously.

I‚Äôve learnt a lot so far and I will definitely continue to use Headway, especially for 23‚Ç¨ a year. 

My only wish: Dear Headway team, please develop a web platform to use on every browser. Or design an easy way to copy text from the app. I want to store my notes on Evernote, but this takes a lot of effort unfortunately."
Really love the UI and content they have, but I think the app is a bit expensive.
Ik hoop dat ze ook een Nederlandse versie intrigeren
I do like the app but it needs a few improvements. After signing up for the trial a yearly sub is pushed. Not weekly or monthly or half year which are all available but they choose for a year. I was too late with cancelling so no alert was given afterwards and 89 euros was invoiced. Also the robotic voice overs are annoying. Only for the fact that they pushed an annual sub I give it a 1 star. App is ok 3 stars and needs improvement.
Happy customer for years. My next book will be number 100! ;-)
"Great app. But very poor voice overs. They sound very robotic and cheap. Please improve. I cant listen to them long enough. 

‚Ä¶ Or use real speakers. Just do something about it."
Some books are nice, others can lack a bit of depth. But today I listened to a book and immediately noticed it was not told by a person but by a sort of robotic voice with weird intonation. I turned it of after 1 second and hope this is not the future of headway, because then I will switch to podcasts again haha
It‚Äôs very unclear how much you have to pay after the 7 day free trial. After 7 days I didn‚Äôt unsubscribe and they debited 90 euros to my account with no warning.
Good books and option to listen instead of reading.
Everything you use on this app is paid but the quality of what you‚Äôre buying is good. Would recommend
"At first I didn‚Äôt think much of the app. Considering that I am a person that do not read a lot.

2 days in, I have read 4 ‚Äòbooks‚Äô that I can relate my self in, motivate my self with. Worthed for 32‚Ç¨ a year!"
No idea why this app is not famous
The whole concept sounds great, but when I saw that you had to pay I thought twice, I wanted to use the free trial which forces you to pay to use it, but the charge was automatically deducted, and when I have access to the application I see that all the books have a robotic voice from TikTok, I understand that a natural voice is complicated but there should be the option to choose between voices, now I am looking for a way to get a refund on the same day of purchase because I did not intend to buy if not to use the free trial, but I will not wait even one day of the free trial period because my money has already been deducted and I am not satisfied, I expected something more. Also now reading other reviews they play with you so that some people pay 23 dollars and others 90 dollars, I paid around 50 euros but if it happened to me that they almost charged me about 80 euros, poor of the people that they wanted a free trial and they got charge 90 dollars for a robotic voice
En dan later bepalen of je al genoeg weet of t boek wil aanschaffen.
I think most of the summaries are a bit too terse and therefore don‚Äôt really stick.
Great app, would‚Äôve paid (with the 70%! discount) for sure if the voices weren‚Äôt so annoying! Whyyyyyyy??? It‚Äôs like listening to Southpark characters doing radioüò≠ thank god for the free trial:(
It‚Äôs just a terrible, spamming app. You have to pay for almost everything, which I did not want. After deleting the app, I got multiple newsletters. I unsubscribed to them, even sent them an email with a request to delete my data, but they are still spamming me with emails.
The collection of books and the summaries are great. But the narration is very poor. If you want to listen or listen and read summaries with pleasant speakers go for Blinkist
"It really helps me expand my mind. I find it hard to read paper books. And I love being on my phone. So whenever I can, instead of social media, I open this app and learn whatever I wanna learn. And I love it. For me it works perfect to read ‚Äòbooks*‚Äô like this.

*it is like summary‚Äôs but I still learn so much from it.

It would be even nicer if it was available to use on my laptop. Because the phone screen is a little small to read long on."
The e-books that are available on headway are great! I love them! The only problem that i have is that many of them are narrated by a robo-voice! If this will be changed then i will give 5 stars!
The voice robot is not so bad 1 or 2 books in. But after that it really becomes difficult to listen too. I wouldnt recommend. They need real people reading this to their listeners.
"Just signed up for the free trial 10minutes ago. Instead of the 7 days free, my card immediately got charged for a subscription. This is not ok√©!
I want to claim the amount charged back and will not be using the app."
Very nice app
I thought i was trying it for a week and cancelled subscribtion directly. Somehow they charged me and claiming jt was a trial was totally not clear for me. Now i am hoping i get my money back through apple support üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ i feel super sad
Easily helps you to find some inspiration amongst a vast variety of books. Would definitely recommend!
This app has altered my life in a positive way
To good to be true But still needs alot more
A good idea. But a mechanical reader without any passion disturbs the joy of listening.
So many books are for men, yet they don‚Äôt have ‚Äúfemale versions‚Äù. It‚Äôs ridiculous
10/10
"It was 3d day, I‚Äôve been trying to take some time for reading (probably listening) and I already see the app gives some ideas, hints and inspiration. 
Especially, I‚Äôd like to mark the productive work of both teams: creative and management, designers and developers. Haven‚Äôt noticed bugs, but should underline awesome UX/UA. 
Best wishes of growing from üá∫üá¶"
Very inspiring to achieve successful life and happy mindset
Gives you the essece of the book, and the main points are presented. Also provides links to buying the complete book if you want to expand your insight a book you like, and read the complete work!
Har du inte tid eller intresse att sitta √• l√§sa massa b√∂cker s√• √§r detta ett v√§ldigt fint s√§tt att f√• en ny syn p√• saker och ting
Useful and good.
It‚Äôs a easy and a good way to access information about different books.
I actually likes this app VERY much! The books that I read in this apps were inspiring and helped motivate me to do more in life! Would recommend to people who wish to be successful or want to improve their grammar or even be motivated!
The books I‚Äôve heared untill now have the same narrator. I do not like his narrotor very much and wish that I did not buy the reduced cost subscription. I hope headway include a 30 day refund in the future - that would have made me happy.
"Some of the books may work if you‚Äôve extremely low self confidence or if you have the same empathy as Sheldon in Big Bang Theory. 
The narrator is also often extremely dull and unpleasant to listen to."
The app uses artificial intelligence to read the summaries from the books they profiled. Unnatural completely and very poor. Some books are almost unrecognizable (which I already read myself). I am stuck in a year subscription :(
I rarely post reviews on abs, but this is the best decision I‚Äôve ever made in my life
It‚Äôs such a motivating and good app. Everything is made simple and easy, yet so informing. Love it already!
Too expensive </3
Boring
Made me do some real changes in life‚Ä¶ because now I read books I would normally never read. Recommend!
Good selection and variety of the books.
Books that help you thrive inn all aspects off life ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è weather itt be: Money, Love, personal controll. Wealth, health, you name itt! This app have itt! hitting the nail you need to be att your best!
Political statements has no place being enforced for the users of this app! Deleting this!
Helps me keep motivated and helps me see the world with different eyes. Love it!
"This is a really cool app, but it has taken 150 dollars out of my bank account which I‚Äôm really gutted and not happy about. The way you bill users is sneaky and misleading, you need to change the way you bill customers or better yet make the app free.

It is constantly sending pop ups that you have to click into to try and make you buy deals for $100 for a year. Very very annoying!"
It‚Äôs not easy to find time to sit and read a book not to mention self development in a busy lifestyle. This app is probably the best compared to other competitors. The app has small test to tailor your own areas of interests and goals based on your preferences. The mascot of the app is super cute. It definitely lifts my mood when I open the app. The UI is easy to navigate to explore different features of the app. Each book has chapter summaries and a final summary. The summary is nicely done include key quotes in the chapters. The final summary also included key learning points. So I can compare with my own notes. I really like the feature that each book we have the option to read/listen and options to forward/backward the chapters when needed. I wish this app will include dark mode options. I do hope it will allow horizontal view on iPad in the future for comfort in near future. The app may not have as many books unlike its competitors. However, the quality of the books and summaries available are better presented. I would prefer quality over quantity. I have no worries more books will be available as time goes. üòâKeep it up team Headway!
Quite good so far. Fun way to learn some decent info quickly
Easy as brother
I won‚Äôt recommend paying for it. It‚Äôs waste of money, not to mention its too expensive for what you can do with it.
I signed up for a 30 day free trial so I could check out this app. I wish I had ticked the monthly fee box because I was charged for the app for a year, over a hundred bucks when I started my trial. I used the app a few times and then the Content options disappeared, and I checked Apple subscriptions have me signed up to next Jan not the 30 days. Now I have to go through apple to get my money back. I am mad
"I have gotten into a great habit of listening to a headway book every morning.
Knowledge is powerful"
So many books I've wanted to read but don't have the time to properly read them, are on the app. In read mode, you can highlight certain points. Such a good idea having a non-fiction book compressed into easy-to-read or listen to sections!
Hazy
Despite being simple summaries of books, I find it very informative in the limited amount to read.
Top app
Evil swine
Find the app so useful. By this times of long hours at work and family deserving our attention, this is an easy way to combine love for books and time with beloved ones. Good as gold!
I‚Äôm not a reader but I enjoy listening. 10-15mins per day of the small bite helps me to build this reading or listening habit. Happy reading everyone.
They take your money, no reminders of trial period ending and just take your money and refuse to give it back
Do you like audio books? Want to read a book but don‚Äôt want to pay $34.99 for it? This app gives you the highlights as a preview for books but emphasises on the main points to make them memorable and impactful. The best part is being able to ‚Äúmemorise‚Äù phrases and add them to your stash to be reminded about later so you can remember them. The books are about 15 minutes long and you can choose to either listen, read or both at the same time. Little achievements are earnt as you progress through the app. Honestly such a greatly thought out app. I am considering buying at the end of my free trial
Amazing! First day using it and fallen in love, would recommend to anyone. I love the option of listening or reading as well as setting a goal. It‚Äôs crazy how a few small books can change your whole mindset!
Easy to use and loads of topics to explore
I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm a bit more in control of my brain after reading on here I really appreciate it üòÉüòä
How do I change the narrators voice and if not please add this as an option like so many other reading Apps
"The idea of this app is to save you time reading books. It will waste your time getting set up and logged in. It was the most frustrating and circular log in process i have ever suffered. Having gotten nowhere, the company refuses a refund, quoting their fine print. I cancelled my subscription and still got reminders that i would be billed in two weeks time. 

So they will take your money AND waste your time!"
Really enjoying the summaries. I‚Äôm up to 3 books, I usually don‚Äôt find the time to read, but having summaries read at 1.5x works for me. Awesomeness.
I don‚Äôt typically read much but this has gotten me into reading, I am however only using the free version which gives me one daily book since I cannot afford to pay.
Gives great summaries and key points to remember from life changing and informative books.
Gives you other ways to deal and think about things in a very simple concise way
This app has helped in many ways, I usually read books from cover to cover but this makes it so much more convenient by taking all the main points of a book and fitting them all in 15 minutes or less. I would recommend this app to anyone who is into self development and would prefer a more quicker and convenient way to learn new things.
"Large selection of books summarised. 
Great setup, easy to use. I've used it for one day and I am hooked"
I love this app due to precise and accurate information on each and every book of chapter.
Some of Headway‚Äôs book summaries are quite useful but others are completely ruined by poor summaries from people to whom English is obviously a second language. I tried really hard for a month to like Headway, but trying to decipher shoddy summaries is a waste of my time. Be warned.
Amazing app!! I am outstandingly thankful for this app. It has opened my eyes in the conclusion of one week. It is more than helpful, so glad I came across knowledge and wisdom like this.
This app has changed so much for me. motivated me to start reading again and allowed me to know so much more about the world and myself in easy to manage amounts. it takes all the waffle out of books and helps you understand the main objective.
Wonderful way to simplify complicated reading.
I love how every book is summarised and on points. Most of popular original books audiobooks are 2-8 hours. And this app gives you the highlight of those book in 10-20 minutes. It‚Äôs amazing how much time this is saving me in personal development üî•
Lo lastimoso es tener que pagar por todo
Excelente
Me gusto mucho
Exelente
Excelente
One of the best apps ever used
se hizo una compra por error pedi mi rembolso y todavia no me dan respuesta.
Pero ser√≠a mejor si tuvieras m√°s opciones en espa√±ol
Son los libros que me gustan y condensan el mensaje principal que el libro quiere plasmar
I wish I knew this before. 10/10!
Necesito que me rembolsen, me cobr√≥ por error
Me gusta porque es directo y puedo tomar los puntos importantes y ponerlos en pr√°ctica. Son r√°pidos y f√°ciles de escuchar.
Realmente me abri√≥ la mente y me hizo reflexionar
A good way to get to learn on traffic
Gran app
"Gracias a la App Headway de crecimiento personal he le√≠do y repasado libros en unos res√∫menes muy bien logrados donde sintetizan cada libro sin distorsionar la idea del autor 
√ötil y pr√°ctico me entretiene, me acompa√±a en el veh√≠culo y tiempos libres, pero lo mejor es que sigo aprendiendo 
Lo recomiendo 
Gracias"
"I will confess, I‚Äôm not a great reader but I love getting information that is useful; one of the best learning methods for me is listening, so this did magics for me!

Specific info, straight to the point, just what you need to know, then you can research and expand your knowledge. 

I loved it!"
Una explicaci√≥n que cumple con lo que indica, sinceramente una buena opci√≥n si quieres empezar con los audiolibros o particularmente como lo hago yo que es escuchar y a la vez ir leyendo!!!..
Muy buen material
Para un redise√±o de exitoso esta aplicaci√≥n cumple su papel de manera extraordinaria. Por miles de libros aprendidos!!!
No permite borrar la cuenta, a√∫n escribiendo la palabra que ellos piden!
Landscape Mode for ipad pro would be really useful
"Siempre me ha costado mucho concentrarme lo suficiente o adentrarme en alg√∫n libro, por m√°s que el tema o trama sean interesantes, suelo dejarlo frecuentemente.
Sin embargo, con Headway me he dado cuenta que puedo concentrar mis ideas y leer tan s√≥lo lo que necesito saber de una manera r√°pida, eficaz y eficiente. 
Llevo una semana con la aplicaci√≥n y la verdad es que estoy muy a gusto y la seguir√© recomendando!"
"Yo no me suscrib√≠ a ning√∫n plan de compra y luego al revisar mis cuentas; me di con la sorpresa de que se cobraron un a√±o y ni siquiera uso la aplicaci√≥n. 

Por favor equipo de Headway; solucionen este error. Gracias."
as√≠ puedes descansar la vista y enfocarte en el mensaje.
Ya puedo cumplir mi meta de leer gracias a esta app
Mientras voy camino a casa me pongo los auriculares y ya estoy entrenando la mente para nuevos desaf√≠os con app.
Me gusta escuchar los libros, sobretodo cuando estoy viajando o haciendo otras labores, disfruto escucharlos.
Muy buena la app, Pero hay algunos libros en ingl√©s. Seria muy bueno la traducci√≥n en simult√°neo üëç
Headway, es un sistema que me est√° ayudando mucho en el d√≠a a d√≠a, me est√° ayudando a crear el h√°bito de enriquecerme todos los d√≠as aunque sea unos minutos ‚Äúmuy valiosos‚Äù me suman un mont√≥n en mi vida.
"No respetan los 7 d√≠as gratis para probar qu√© tal es la app.
They do not respect the 7 free days to test how the application is."
Las lecturas gratuitas son muy buenas
Invalorable fuente de conocimiento
Hace tiempo me hab√≠a planteado empezar a leer a ritmo m√°s creciente y el haberme cruzado con Headway fue crucial. ü§©
"La √∫nica manera de alcanzar la Excelencia personal y profesional es forjando el conocimiento d√≠a a d√≠a,
Juan110584"
Hace dos semanas la app no se ve ning√∫n libro y ya la actualice
Recomiendo esta aplicaci√≥n y poder adaptarla a tu estilo de vida. El conocimiento es la base para progresar en todos y cada uno de los campos.
La idea es muy buena y puede ser funcional, pero no hay libros a los cuales se puede acceder sin pagar y esta es una l√°stima. Solo hay un libro del d√≠a que se puede escuchar pero te lo escoge la app. Es una l√°stima porque la idea inicial era buena
No doy 5 estrellas a√∫n porque a m√≠ sincera opini√≥n todos los libros qu√© hay dentro de la app realmente deber√≠an ser gratuitos ya que en los libros est√° la fuente del conocimiento y eso realmente es y ser√≠a un bien para la sociedad ya que esto se pr√°ctica cada vez menos y deber√≠an fomentar m√°s la pr√°ctica de la lectura aunque sea de esa manera porque si se trata de negocio estamos empezando mal ya que lo mejor ser√≠a llegar a todas las personas de manera gratuita a descargar todos los libros de la app y puntuar 5 estrellas. Sin dudas ganar√≠an m√°s por p√∫blico, estrellas y por el tiempo que la gente le dedicar√≠a m√°s a esta app que considero muy buena pero no excelente
Este libro te ense√±a a c√≥mo amarte para poder amar ‚Ä¶ lleg√≥ en un momento indicado ;)
Fascinante app para leer m√°s y ayuda con audio, aprendizaje y mejora garantizados !
Sus res√∫menes son precisos y muy bien resumidos. Me encanta su aporte en mi d√≠a a d√≠a.
La vida nos golpear√° en todo momento, pero depende de uno mismo si caer, a seguir avanzando. Por lo general las personas estamos interesados en ser grandes como persona, tener √©xito, dinero, etc. Sin embargo esto es posible para toda persona. Sin excepci√≥n; todo depende de nosotros, de nuestros pensamientos. Si proyectamos y programamos nuestra mente lo lograremos, por m√°s duro que sea el camino, si tenemos esa visi√≥n, de trabajar d√≠a a d√≠a, hora a hora, minuto a minuto, no hay nada ni nadie que nos detenga hasta lograr nuestro objetivo.
Buenos res√∫menes de libros, se podr√≠a profundizar a√∫n m√°s y ampliar los cap√≠tulos
"Es una herramienta muy moderna de aprender cosas que no podr√≠as hacerlo leyendo horas de horas. La aplicaci√≥n te hace un resumen muy sencillo y did√°ctico de los libros. El n un solo
D√≠a ya le√≠ dos libros usando solo algunos momentos libres de mi recargadas labores."
Mucho tiempo que no me concentraba en leer nuevos temas y me ayuda a descubrir nuevas experiencias.
P√©simo app tengan cuidado por que realizan cobros indebidos. Hace varias semanas cancel√© mi suscripci√≥n y hoy me doy con la sorpresa de que a√∫n cuando cancele me cobraron! Devuelvan √©l dinero!!!
Contenido valioso y f√°cil de escuchar en cualquier momento del d√≠a.
Llevo pocos d√≠as us√°ndolo, y aunque versi√≥n free, me da textos muy interesantes y concretos. Lo recomiendo, seguir√© us√°ndolo y en lo posible aplicando sus recomendaciones
Me encanta, todos los d√≠as aprendo algo.
Me encanta porque tiene una variedad de libros de libros en ingl√©s y en espa√±ol y los res√∫menes van directo al grano.
Por favor me registre para la prueba gratis de una semana y no he podido usarla ni un d√≠a! No es para mi. Ma√±ana vence la prueba gratis y quiero salirme para que NO me carguen por la suscripci√≥n
Aprender leyendo y est√° app me facilita la vida haciendo un resumen escuchando. Me encanta!!!
Love it!
Nunca leer hab√≠a sido tan facil
Contenido bastante atractivo e interesante.
Recomendada para tu salud y desarrollo personal
Me gusta mucho esta app, pero no tengo tantas opciones de libros en espa√±ol, hay muchos mas libros en ingl√©s, deber√≠an sugerir libros de acuerdo al idioma que habla cada persona.
Extra√±aba leer y aprender, pero ten√≠a poco tiempo. La app te permite leer un libro con 15 o menos minutos al d√≠a. Los resumes van al punto.
Desde que uso esta aplicaci√≥n mi curiosidad y entusiasmo por la lectura se ha desbordado y me siento muy feliz. Aprender y desaprender me lleva al desarrollo y crecimiento emocional que estoy buscando.
Esta aplicaci√≥n me ayud√≥ en unos de los momentos m√°s complicados de mi vida. Recomendado.
Muy buena app
La descargue pensando que iba a ser gratis pero todo es comprar . No lo recomiendo
The content in Discover does not load.  Repetition has missing buttons
I rarely got time to read or buy all the self help book I want, this has been the perfect app for me that is occupied majority of the time so I want something easy to absorb. All the love! ü§ç
I was double charged weekly and annual =( i hope my money could be returned for my meds =(
Very helpful app!
It is my second day and I can say that I am deeply learning.
I love this app! I hope you can add a landscape view on Ipad.
"I was really not expecting this to happen. After I delete the app, i did cancel my subscription, but as of tonight. My Money that supposed to be paid for medicines for my mother was gone. For the Whole year subscription. 
Now, im dying to find where i can look for that money nowüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠"
Simple and Very Effective App who wants to learn more in a very short time. ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
I really enjoyed using this app. It‚Äôs much efficient and easy for me to read and digest ideas every day. I always find it overwhelming to read a whole book but this app helped me to feed my mind with information in bite-sizes.
I never thought I‚Äôd go for a subscription, but the trial book was summarized that is easy to digest. It was a great experience, and I decided to go for it because I love reading great books. This app helps me finish more books and gain understanding quickly‚Äîa surefire way to learn faster and save time.
I love how factual and informative your books are making them easy and faster to finish.
"Two days in, and so far so good!
I like that I‚Äôm done in 15 minutes, but got the gist of the book!"
I take notes when I read books but this app is top notch. I subscribed for the yearly subscription and its def the greatest self investment I made for this year. Thanks for making me a better person each day Headway.
It‚Äôs easy to use and navigate books to read
"Headway used to work flawlessly with macOS, via iPad app sideloading via App Store. But now it doesn't work anymore.

Can y'all fix this in the future? Thanks"
I am really happy with using this app. There are a-lot of books to read and easily get to know what this book is about. Honestly it is continuously making an impact on my life.
They offered me a 28 day free trial and as soon as i signed up for it, all the money were deducted from my account, i dont want this stupid app i want my refund ASAP
App worth having. Very detailed, but not overloaded summaries. Easy to understand, read and digest. You can see the actions that each book advises you to take straight away. Summaries don‚Äôt take longer than 20 minutes, usually about 15, which keeps you very motivated. Life changing. I think they‚Äôve done an excellent job.
Most books have heavy christian bias and mention god and are set in christian morality. I found them cringeworthy and worthless. Waste of time and money
How many books you can read till the end of life? Reading a book takes couple od hours and Headway summaries take dozen minutes. You get well descirbed essence of any book chosen. I love it!
So after a few days ‚Äútrial‚Äù I am automatically charged without notice or question. Seems closer to a scam rather than subscription. Beware!
"This app requires a SUBSCRIPTION to work. 
It‚Äôs not a free app. 
Stupid app makes you take 5 minutes long test and THEN tells you to pay money to proceed. It should just be a PAID app. Waste of time."
"Hi! 
I very enjoy this app but unfortunately, I don‚Äôt know why, charged me twice at one time.  Can you help me with this issue?"
I enjoy reading here every day - 15 minutes lectures are easy to follow and learn new facts & tips from books (even if I don‚Äôt have subscription). I love conclusions at the-end-chapter. Main issues for me are: 1. Too expensive for normal use (in Poland), 2. Not rotating the screen while reading (rotating would be helpful when using iPad!)
Top notch. GIVE IT A TRY
"The app will add additional goods/services and CHARGE YOUR CARD WITHOUT CONSENT.
Tricksters! Do not recommend"
Just use it.
Maybe are here rich ppl who can spend their money on any application without check them first, but usually ppl don‚Äôt Want spend their money in this way. Why application wants me to install it, and after long proces of gathering informatorom about me The application shows The info about subscription? So I need to spend a lot of my time and at the end i need to pay for it anyway. There isn‚Äôt a chance to check application without paying or PIT your credit card. This app is so bad.
Reading mode is so pleasant to look at (and read ofc!)
I was sceptical initially with their approach but listen the book with the most important summary is great idea. I‚Äôm motivated to read the full book now
Is it just me or is a number of books telling you to turn to Bible (not even Religion) to change your life/thinking etc.? Also the robotic, lifeless voice makes me cringe
The app itself is easy to follow. There is no pressure to follow the steps included in the app. Books that are recommended suits needs of the user. I am surprised how good that app is.
One of the greatest and most helpful app ever! Highly recommended:)
When app offers you subscription for 399pln and checking for different plan reduces the price by nearly 30% seconds later - it feels like a literal financial scam. Monthly plan twice as expensive as yearly payment.
Like this app. Use it to improve my English skills and learn a lot
"First of all, I‚Äôm learning to listen‚Ä¶ Cause I talk a lot ü§≠ Second, it kind of reads my mind and daily readings I get are üéØ have direct connection with my professional personal or any situation. 
I‚Äôll wait for an offer and get it for a year. Step by step. Thank you for sharing the light of wisdom and helping to see and understand many things more objectively. Recommend ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
"As with other apps from this developer, they do not obey to apple AppStore policies: In app purchases are extras, not the app itself. So I just lost 15 minutes answering a questionar only to be greeted by a ‚Äúpay a trial‚Äù to proceed to the app.
‚ÄúIn app purchases‚Äù means I can get extra content in the app if I decide to pay for it, you can let users create a free trial using a mobile number, you don‚Äôt need to get credit card info and all Personal data.
Also it is a very very unethical practice having a user spend 15 minutes of their life giving personal data answering questionares only to be greeted by a ‚Äúgive us you info for the free trial to see the results‚Äù
Unethical and I feel like I am using Google play store. 
Didn‚Äôt get an iPhone for this"
Amazing experience‚Ä¶ excellent book reviews and fell in love with the visual explainers
"It allows us to read big books and acknowledge all these big and valid ideas in just a couple of minutes everyday.

I think it would be great to kinda have a feature where, in case of not understanding something properly, it would send us to the part of the book that explains that idea."
Para quem n√£o sabe ingl√™s n√£o serve
So many good books to read, but so little time. Headway is the solution :)
Top
Esta aplicaci√≥n tiene un modo gratuito donde te regalan un libro por d√≠a de los temas que eleg√≠s. Los res√∫menes est√°n muy bien hechos y la voz del lector es muy tranquila
Las lecturas seleccionadas son ideales para aprovechar el tiempo y nutrir nuestras mentes
Content is excellent, computer voices are terrible. Pity because I mainly use it when walking
Found this app by chance but it has been great to read/listen books that could interest me, and I haven‚Äôt even spent a cent yet !
"I subscribed for 12 months and there was another book or something popping up right after I confirmed the subscription; as I didn‚Äôt know the app and thought it would be the first book to read/listen to, but little did I know that by adding it I automatically paid for it!! 
Contacted support right away but they just kept telling me no refunds!! 
Would not recommend and be careful where you tap or your moneys gone!!"
Muchos t√≠tulos interesantes y bien resumidos
La voz para los audiolibros al principio me desconcentraba porque sonaba rob√≥tica pero me termin√© acostumbrando y poniendo el foco en em contenido, que s√≠ es muy bueno üëåüèºüëåüèº
It‚Äôs really helpful for learning the pronunciation of the words and also learn about the topic that you like
Esta muy bueno
Muy interesante escuchar y leer temas varios
No tiene la opci√≥n de filtrar solo libros en espa√±ol? Me recomienda solo libros en ingl√©s ü•∫
Me resulta muy practico leer con esta aplicaci√≥n, es muy din√°mica y puedo leer a donde est√© a la hora que sea
It‚Äôs a great way to have more knowledge about some important books, this is comes with a perfect and lovely way.
Love each book and the voice of the man speaking is really calm
Worth it!! I easily read the summaries of the book or sometimes just listen to them before going to sleep. Much better than reading full books for me since I don‚Äôt have time in my day.
Exceptional work!
Bro, it‚Äôs not working.
Hi, just a heads-up for everyone. I wanted to try to app for one month for which I was charged $7 dollars, which is oke. But then I was charged for another $15 for some "extra features" that they carefully hidden in the original transaction. When I contacted their support asking for a refund they say it's my fault that I didn't see their scam. And obviously this was somehow made trough an external payment system and it doesn't show up as an apple subscribtion or payment.
Great
Just great! üî•
amazing app fr
i have started to dedicate more time to reading than simply scrolling mindlessly on social media. this one has great summaries, good functionality and features set, and i am pretty happy about it. content wise, there are better alternatives like blinkist, but they don‚Äôt have audio books, not much to complain, it‚Äôs a library worth having
Highly recommended
I got the ad for the app on Instagram which redirected me to theirs website with the same name, logo and everything. It seemed nice and I got the subscription but when I tried to access my account on the app it didn‚Äôt recognize the subscription. Apparently you can only access their courses only in a browser which is so weird, considering the app is the same concept. I cancelled my subscription and requested a refund for the yearI  already paid for as it‚Äôs not very user friendly or available in a browser but they were entirely unhelpful, saying that other than cancelling my subscription there‚Äôs nothing they can do. If they truly cared about their customers they would have given me a refund. I‚Äôm deeply disappointed.
Thank you üôèüèΩüåàüêûGod bless us all
I am not much of a reader, time won‚Äôt let me but with this app I‚Äôm able to get a lot of useful information in less time, while also doing my work.
It has a wide variety on content, the narration needs improvement (a little to ‚Äúrigid‚Äù to the ears)
Nothing free on the app.. not even some little things...no thank you
Pay attention when purchasing it - the ad was missleading i paid for a feature i do not need, infographics. I kindly asked for a refund immediatly the day after and they refused it. Poor customer service.
This app helped me creating a habit of listening 1-2 books first thing in the morning, while taking a walk through the neighbourhood.
Amazing!
You get one free book daily. Great for commutes, night routines for when you feel low energy but you still want to do something productive or simply for downtime.
During my first day of using the app I read 5 books (summaries) Its amazing how fast the information flows
For reading
It is great for people who have busy life. I recommend it
The audio summary is an amazing idea
I love you guys
I only have had it for a week so far , and wow it has done a great change for me I love the diversity of the books and the challenges they offer ! This is such an inspiring app
This app helped me in preparing my English test review. You can practice your reading and listening skills. You can also enhance your vocabulary and grammar. I highly recommend this.
Love it.
If hate reading big and long books it‚Äôs perfect fit your u. It contains Audiobooks and insights of the chapter üòç and the app is adorable
Save time , you can get the most important notes from each book
They will bother you to buy, and it‚Äôs not as good as it‚Äôs competitive.
It‚Äôs a really great summaries for books
Not bad
Awesome useful app, almost the best
Very easy to navigate and the summary of the books has the information you need.
Its amazing
Very helpful. Easy to navigate. Theyre not just about the money, as you can still use the app even with the free version. The ‚Äúlisten‚Äù option is a great way to learn while multitasking. Really thankful for this app!
Its too generous from the developers to let people benefits from the app without a single payment this will encourage people to read and listen more and possibly actually paying to benefit even more to get to the headway
"Hey all,

A very lovely, vibrant and soothing App. wide verity of good topics with decent Ref., sadly the only thing I found it irritating in it, is first there‚Äôs only one voice over option and I‚Äôm sorry to the performer but he sounded a little bit like a poser.(sorry, only an opinion).
and the price is kinda high.  
GL:)!
.
and yes almost forgot, the UI in it is outstanding and easy to navigate with tips and explanations for almost everything.
.
three days intensive usage opinion."
"The application designed with easy way
That‚Äôs making you come back and search 
For more information and you can set target 
And time which I find it useful"
Kindly; return my money back to me ‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt want to continue with your app.
It perfect app to  read and to listen. I like the type of books
A propoganda app promoting capitalistic and mainly gender political views‚Ä¶..
So inspiring
I really feel lazy to read a book , but this app helped me read, listen and visualize really awesome informative books i need. Thanks
Gr8
great app. full with useful information. I haven‚Äôt subscribed yet, but I can read a summary a day for free üíúüòª
A variety of books, very convenient to listen when commuting to work. I like the memos.
"So‚Ä¶ got super excited to incorporate this app in my life and enabling learning more in compact form‚Ä¶ and then‚Ä¶ I heard the narrators voices üò≠
I hoped it was just a few books with tone-dead voices but now I‚Äôve come to listen to around 20 of them, and it‚Äôs not better. CHANGE YOUR NARRATORS PLEASE.

They make or break this app - and I‚Äôm deleting it for this reason. Sorry."
+++
Really worths more than the money I‚Äôv purchased it, very satisfied! I wonder if it‚Äôs possible to add dictionaries in the pages of the books, if there will be dictionaries then it will be also a good source of learning English for some people where there are reading, listening, pronunciation and everything for me as a English learner it‚Äôs the best while in other hand it has massive amounts very essential, worthy  and life changing books with great authors üëç
Love this App
"I made it a habit to listening to one book per day sometimes twice and since then I have never felt insecure or anxious or sad from others 
Its ben a year now. Highly recommended"
Seriously? This app is ridiculous, is it made by men for men only? Are we still living in 1950s? This is the worst crap-selfhelping-app so far, the informative text are unreal, read a real book and step outside your own bubble instead.  It‚Äôs functions are nice but too many of the texts are too idiotic.
Got deducted 995 (100$) SEK for an annual subscription after a full year of not being able to use it. Subscribed a year ago at a discount but havent been able to use the subscription and have instead been told to pay the money i have already spent, on the same subscription. Sadly just a an expensive scam.
Exorbitant prices for worthless content. Don‚Äôt download or you might accidentally pay for a years subscription with a single mis-press. You have to pay to see the results of free surveys etc. so there‚Äôs no point unless you want to buy a subscription. Hold out for a discount if you are thinking of paying, in 10min I was offered the same subscription at four different prices.
I never leave reviews but this app is amazing!
Great assessment test and suggestions of books. Easy to listen, inspiring and straight to the point. Bite size crucial information on different subjects! I love and recommend this app! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Really helpful for efficient learning love this app
En bra och enkel app som sammanfattar b√∂cker och √§r inspirerande. D√• du kan lyssna och l√§sa samtidigt üëçüèª
$30 base subscription fee. Turns out, to get more than one or two free daily reads one has to pay about $100 a year. Just unclear advertising.
I‚Äôm only at the begining, but like it a lot already
There are some good titles in here, but also a lot of American motivational/evangelical stuff about ‚Äúbeing a better person‚Äù, ‚Äúhow to cultivate the habits of winners‚Äù and other toxic rubbish. It‚Äôs definitely an app made by Americans for Americans and it is fully immersed in US cultural values. I look forward to Headway building a more diverse international library.
This truly is an amazing app! For someone who never finishes a book otherwise I‚Äôve gotten so much new knowledge from listening to the summaries. One feedback would definitely be to somehow make it more clear which books I‚Äôve already read (with a little marker or something) as I often forget if I‚Äôve already read it, until I press it and start listening. Otherwise it‚Äôs perfect.
Really liking this app and am gonna use it to save much time on books ! I would like to know why they have chosen to summaries each book within 15 mins. Surely some books might have more information to be summarised, am I missing some summarised information because of the 15 min cut off ??
"I used to struggle to read traditional paperback books but loved learning all the knowledge inside them. My eyes got heavy just after a few pages and eventually I would asleep without having made much progress ü•±üò¥

Headway has truly found a genius way to cut out the fluff and made it easy to plow through a book in 15 minutes or less. That is priceless to me."
Appen har ett flertal b√∂cker som √§r enkla att f√∂rst√•. Du har m√∂jlighet att b√•de lyssna och l√§sa. Det finns en bok f√∂r alla!
Perfect and straight to the point üëå
Appen sammanfattar oftast b√∂ckerna p√• ett kort och koncist s√§tt. B√∂cker som tenderar att bli v√§ldigt repetitiva kan man nu f√• en √∂verblick p√• ist√§llet. Sammanfattningarna som g√∂r dig nyfiken indikerar att det kan vara v√§rt att investera i och l√§sa hela!
I really take time to read now
Fant√°stica app .
"Nowadays, We are all busy to learn & valueadd daily, but with this Headway app reading digesting your book summary/gist is seamless & very helpfulüëç
Thanks Team Headwayüôè"
Keep it up
Have been using Blinks for a year and wanted to try out something different.  Tried Headway out for only a day and did not like the way the readers we reading.  I believe they were using a software AI reader and there was no soul in the reading.  Blinks had this.  Going to give this up and continue with blinks.
"I was searching for the book, SPARE on Prince Harry but unfortunately till now it‚Äôs not available. 

BLINKLIST already has a copy."
The collection of books are really good and the summarisation algorithm is great as well. You can also listen to the summarised text while you are exercising or cycling.
"1. Read, listen and watch on the go
- Ability to choose to listen to the script like a podcast or read off the text or both! You can even refer to the visuals explainers which are very fun to watch!

2. Summary pointers
- Very helpful, if you want to recall and reflect what you read/listened to.

3. Succinct
- Mentioned all the important pointers or gist of the book.

4. Book suggestions
- A great app that can actually suggest you book titles if you might want to read more about!"
Reading the books makes me rethink of the life choices i need change and make.
I love to read, but to read more books at my convenience is impossible sometimes. Headway made me read anywhere, anytime, effortlessly! It made me buy the books that i want to keep for my library sometimes. Just awesome!
Great app for learning with brief!
Never have time to finish reading book .. this speed things up
Really great app!
The lessons are good and productive
"There is no quality control for the book summaries, failing to lay out proper key points, with writing that does not flow within each section, poor formatting for text etc. And all you had to reference was how well Blinkist has done on this part.

I feel for the design team as clearly the ones in charge of summary content failed them."
Good to read
You are able to enter, but only one free book per day.
Reduce time spent on reading the whole book
Good read .. makes you think and plan your carrier
After listening to the audio summary, I have come up with a new term called ‚Äúno-fault-separation‚Äù. My wife and myself are in the midst of seeing a few pro-bono counsellors and cannot afford a lawyer nor advocates and trying to legalise A SEPERATION. Thus, a no-fault-SEPERATION should be what we are looking for.
I find this app enjoyable and easy to use
Just started. I personally liked it.
Love the app. Can listen and read at the same time!
Hi, can you please explain why my account was charged? I have already cancelled my subscription. Why am I still charged? I demand a full refund please!
Easy to read and inspiring. Loves it. Finish within 15mins
This is probably the fastest way of getting to the things I need from reading a book. Crisp summaries!
So far so good. Downloaded the app because my friend recommended it..
Great for users who are always on the go and needs to be nourished as well.
"Useful and interesting books even though the synthesis misses some key points. 

Only three stars as no iPad or horizontal / landscape mode üòí"
Although the summaries do not replace the actual reading of the book, they are perfect to read/listen if you want to decide you want to go for the book. Also they are very helpful to brush up my memory after I have read the book. Five ‚≠êÔ∏è
I love that we have the option to ‚Äúremember‚Äù summaries in each book, and save them to our cards to view at any time. However, I wish to have the flexibility to ‚Äúremember‚Äù any portion of text, not just those that we are given the option to. I also wish to be able to edit and customise the text on my cards to my liking. If the developers can make this happen, it‚Äôll make the app have so much more flexibility! Thank you
But will get there
"The app has amazing, inspiring and eye opening books you can read or listen to!
The books positively changed the way I think and operate!
Would recommend gettinng 10/10!
Great job Headway"
At first i bought Headways subscription for 15‚Ç¨ and thought that was it, but then i was charged double and paid 30‚Ç¨. Didn‚Äôt find the supports contact so im voicing my concerns here. I hope this will reach the developer and I hope for a full refund.
"I find this application very usefull. I‚Äôve had a wish of reading lots of books on self improving, but first problem is finding quality books and second find the time, the motivation to reading them.
So this is where I find this practical, because the app makes it easier for me in each way to gain knowledge and improve myself.
Thank you. For now I‚Äôve ‚Äúread‚Äù 4 books where 3 of them were very informative the other one was not my style."
Helps to keep you in check to read a few insightful words needed to stay positive throughout the day
"If you want to read books, but you rarely do. Try this, it so nice and condensed. And if you really like a summary of one book you can go out and get that book for you. Its also nice theres audio and text versions for each book and that you can download everything and listen to it offline.
Try this, you will feel better about yourself."
Headway trial cannot be canceled via settings - apple id - subscriptions. Instead it offers tens of subscription options. I went through them all, there is no way how to cancel this. Feels like a rip off.
Great way to make daily progress and habit of learning üëå
Every time I finish a book and then later re-read a few pages or my notes I've pulled out, it marks it as unread. I have to keep marking it as read. It's annoying. Once I read it, it should stay marked as read.
Pretty straight forward reading, amazing when you read and listen simultaneously.

Really easy for beginners on readers and start looking on what‚Äôs can be interested by each of us
Me gusta porque es una s√≠ntesis del libro. Y puedo leer diario en pocos minutos.
Me encanto la forma tan sencilla de explicar como funciona la dopamina en el cerebro. Todas las cualidades que posee y las consecuencias de su mal uso.
"It‚Äôs an amazing way to go straight to the point.
Today is not easy to find time to read a 1000 pages book. 
Here you simplify my world leaving only the essence .
Also since I‚Äôm not a native English speaker it help me to improve my fluency by learning new words .
I‚Äôm in a trail right now but I think it will be a good tool for me during the coming days"
Excelente aplicaci√≥n muy educativa y fant√°stica, altamente recomendada
Truly helpful and filled with inspirational material.
Incredible. I'm speechless. It's extremely helpful listening in the morning and evening to book summaries. It gives me support on what I'm doing and what i want to achieve..big thanks, top app.
Easy to listen or read
Great app with great interface and features but one thing i don't like is the summaries are not the best. It sounds like a bunch of ideas and points crammed into 6-10 pages and no idea is truly being analyzed and expanded on with a clear evidence or example or simple analogies that explains the idea well. It breeds a lack of validity and effectiveness of these ideas.

It easy to read and to digest all the informations when someone already done a hard work for you. I like the challenge and the short visual section. It would be nice if I can change the font at least between serif and sans-serif. Moreover I'm not native English so really wish you have translation feature(basic one will be enough) or feature for saving words for me to review them later. Thank you Headway Teams! ü•πüôèüèªüíï‚ú®
Nice and worth . There are a lot of good books on shelves!
Recommended! Worth the time
Great app
Really need the opinion to export books highlight, so we can collect them in our note taking apps, or even add the to Readwise library.

Are you going to support lanscape mode? Lots of users use ipad with keyboard you should care about magic keyboard users.
Only listened to 2 book so far I love it
I like it
"After my Blinkist subscption ended, wanted to give Headway a try. To start with summaries are not as good, library is limited compared to blinkist. Also serious usability issues : no rotation on iPad, no personal collection possible to group your books, no family sharing.
After Blinkist, feels like a beta app at best."
After my one week trial ended, I opened the app twice and both lead to the crash of my iPhone. First time in 5 years an app is crashing my phone. Actually I was thinking to take their %50 discount offer for the subscription but I didn‚Äôt like this crashing issue. Hence uninstalled.
Please it would be great if an autimatic scrolling down feature is added
Amazing
I urge AppStore to delete this app for permoting terrorists
I love the idea of reading but never get round to it. After downloading this app, with its subscription, I can read well written summaries on some of the best books. I was very surprised to see Jordan B Petersons book on there and am excited to see what other gems they have to offer.

This app steals your money. It automatically signs you up for a 1 year subscription period for $89 US when you choose a 1 week free trial and then takes it the day before the subscription free trial period is done. It is a complete scam!!!!!
"I m glad I found it, because my reading list was overwhelming and I just couldn‚Äôt even start one book and get focused . Because it was too many ahead 

But Headway gives really a nice summary of insights üëå just enough to get ideas, get interested. 

Some books after that seem to obvious and not worthy of time. But others seem so interesting, that I m willing to read the full version"
The app is solely free for the Ukrainians. There‚Äôs a lot to learn from to master your skills and improve your life
I fell in love with this app from the very first time. One can choose subjects of interest for reading here and get recommendations. Books‚Äô summaries are high-quality written. I find this app useful in sticking to reading and love to get encouragements and tips. I love that I can both get new knowledge and keep learning English. What can I say? Well-done! Keep it up, guys ‚ù§Ô∏è!

"A high-quality product. It‚Äôs great to review the books I‚Äôve already read, the summaries are great! Also, I enjoy the opportunity to get familiar with the new book without spending much time reading. In case I want to have a deep dive, I would look for a full version anytime. But so far I‚Äôve been satisfied because reading a whole book takes too long while having a small kid.

"Great books, good summary, great system to highlight, memorize or look up words/books you have read!
Audio books all included, there are infographic as paid contents too"
It keeps loading the contents forever.
I capture great ideas in short period of time. I often highlight good insights in the book but find it hard when i want to review them. Suggest to improve UI to make highlights easy to access.
"I got 1 week free trial with this app. I event marked on my calendar to cancel the subscription before due date. Then they sent me 1 noti that i didn't remember where they show up: my cancelation did not work, then they charged me.
I‚Äôm really disappointed about the app and the way it work.
I try it after seeing their Ad but the content of the app was boring and not diversity.

I love this app so much. It helps me learn English a lots
Thank you for your advice I learning a lot of things of positive and my medical will improve it
Love this app
This app can be great but you have to pay a large amount of money for something you might not even use. I recommend rather stay away before you waste money.
I love how much I have learned from this app. The book summary liberate me cause I don‚Äôt have to read the whole book for me to get the point of the author ‚ô•Ô∏èüå∏
Just paid for a subscription, so far I‚Äôve been taken through the same questions 3 times, been spammed by Headway adverts whilst inside the Headway App asking me to buy more things and I have access to NOTHING? I‚Äôm so confused - what have I paid for???
Headway is extremely interesting and inspiring. It suggest books you‚Äôd love according. I love it üòÄ
Headway is helping me to prioritise developing myself. The summaries are informative and easy to read and listen to. Love it!
Hey my little brother downloaded this app without my knowledge. Is it possible for me to get a refund ?
The summaries I have been reading have done enough in motivating me and helping me direct my life more, in all aspects. Namely- business, career, relationships and my future
App immediately took a full payment for the whole year. And i never recieved the week free trial
Great investment!
After download and payment then registration one simply cant use the app. Balloon pop ups keep on popping up to sell more but nothing works. This is a useless application
"Headway looks interesting and gets you motivated at the start. But, after they ask you a lot of questions and gives you tests they then ask you to pay monthly and that was annoying and just wasted my time because it literally says everything is free!!!
So yeah bad information and advertising but if you have the money it‚Äôs a really good app"
Is a refund available?
It‚Äôs makes learning easier and more efficient big thumbs up from me
All the things I was confused or unsure about a put into perspective and are now clear to me .
"I've been using the app for over a year now and love it!  
Those individuals who don't have time to invest in finding Books will love this easy to use system plus it reads out load, perfect for travel or waiting in lines ."
I have paid for 3 month subscription and received email to confirm subscription but when logging in the the prompts come up to subscribe and pay. I also can‚Äôt find a way to contact the developers.
This app has improved my morning life.
I‚Äôm really happy with this app. The summaries are great and they don‚Äôt require a lot of time. Unfortunately most of them require you to pay. But all in all a great app for personal development on the run. Highly recommended
I was double charged and the company will not acknowledge their fault. Be very cautious and I suggest you reconsider doing business with headway.  I feel like I have been hustled by a pick pocketer
"After my 7 day free trial, I was not asked/prompted to select a package. 
I was automatically billed upfront for a full year on a premium package.

Also there is no clear distinction of what is included in the standard vs extras in the premium package."
I was really looking forward to starting my journey, but I couldn‚Äôt even get off the ground. I sent an email to the team requesting that my email address be changed but this is yet to be done. It feels like I‚Äôve wasted money on a subscription I have no access to; therefore I‚Äôve received no pleasure from this app.
Same complaint as all other comments. Would like a refund‚Ä¶..but I guess that is not ever happening. Paid for year‚Ä¶..
I have read 8 summarised books this week alone! I am thankful for Headway and for how easy they break every thing down for you! It makes me love reading even more.
I enjoy the efficiency!
"Headview has a beautiful user interface design. 
A vast library of books and topics to choose from. 
Easy to use and does what it claims to do.
Very convenient for summarising books and getting the important information out of them."
easy to read and easy to learn
The subscription prompt and free trial is misleading! You subscribe and then it immediately it takes a year subscription and never gives an option to try the free trial. VERY MISLEADING! ‚Ä¶and very hard to get hold of them. Super frustrating and sneaky!
You should understand these fundamentals before getting involved in any relationship. Essential advice for successful life time relationships.
I love how the summary goes straight to the point. No tautology. An easy read
It said 7 day free trial but immediately debited full amount of year subscription.
Just love this app above all the competition. They truly capture the essence of each book spurring you to take the action you need to apply the principles effectively. Each summary is captivating and inspiring!!
While I‚Äôm driving or flying this app is my go too!!
Brilliant content; easy to use and informative
"Summary of the key points is good for me as I then quickly grasp the main point.

The clear call to action gives me ability to journal things that I have to change and be better."
